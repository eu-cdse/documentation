## General

::: {#general-1 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 1.What is the phase-out timing for the current Copernicus Data Hub distribution services?

The legacy Copernicus Data Hub distribution service remained in operations until end of June 2023 to allow a smooth migration to the new Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem by all user communities. The Copernicus Data Hub distribution service continued to offer access to Sentinel data  with a gradual ramp-down of the operations capacity and data offering until end of October 2023.

## APIs

::: {#apis-1 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 1.Where can I find detailed information regarding the duration of Access tokens and Refresh tokens?

The access token is valid for 10 minutes, after 10 minutes, it expires. When Access Token expires, it must either be refreshed by using the Refresh Token or be re-generated. The refresh token is valid for 60 minutes and can be used multiple times within that 60 minutes. The returned access token is again valid for 10 mins. For more information, please refer to the [Quotas and Limitations](/Quotas.qmd) section of our documentation. Also please refer to the [OData](/APIs/OData.qmd) section of our documentation for more information on Access and Refresh Tokens.

STAC Catalog API is indeed planned. The data is already available over S3 as well. 
:::

::: {#apis-3 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 3.Will Long Term Archive (LTA) process be discontinued when all archived data become Online?

There will still be services available for so called “deferred data access”: data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all of the most relevant collections will be available Online. The [Roadmap](/Roadmap.md) shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.
:::

::: {#apis-4 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 4.Will the platform use STAC standards?

[STAC Product Catalog](/APIs/STAC.qmd) is available. However there may be issues with using the current version with generic STAC libraries. Our dedicated teams are actively working on its development to ensure a seamless experience for all users. Nevertheless it already supports basic product search.

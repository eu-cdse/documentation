    <p>Depending on your use, we suggest to use the high-res print (via the high-res print tab) where you will get large areas in a high resolution (the data is though not georeferenced). If you need georeferenced data, split your area in several smaller images that you download or choose a bit lower resolution to stay within the limits of 2500px.</p>

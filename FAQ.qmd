## General

::: {#general-1 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 1.What is the phase-out timing for the current Copernicus Data Hub distribution services?

The legacy Copernicus Data Hub distribution service remained in operations until end of June 2023 to allow a smooth migration to the new Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem by all user communities. The Copernicus Data Hub distribution service continued to offer access to Sentinel data  with a gradual ramp-down of the operations capacity and data offering until end of October 2023.

STAC Catalog API is indeed planned. The data is already available over S3 as well. 
:::

::: {#apis-3 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 3.Will Long Term Archive (LTA) process be discontinued when all archived data become Online?

There will still be services available for so called “deferred data access”: data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all of the most relevant collections will be available Online. The [Roadmap](/Roadmap.md) shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.
:::

::: {#apis-4 .callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
## 4.Will the platform use STAC standards?

[STAC Product Catalog](/APIs/STAC.qmd) is available. However there may be issues with using the current version with generic STAC libraries. Our dedicated teams are actively working on its development to ensure a seamless experience for all users. Nevertheless it already supports basic product search.

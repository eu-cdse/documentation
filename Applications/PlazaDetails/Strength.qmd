The following are among the popular services available in OpenEO Algorithm Plaza. Here, we have presented an average credit strength for these services. Please note that the credits can vary slightly depending on the time interval and area of interest.

The purpose of this document is to solely provide users with an assumption on how these credits work and their strength for varying services.

##### NDVI

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a key indicator of vegetation health. It is calculated by comparing the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs) in satellite imagery.
Calculating the NDVI of a square hectare costs 3-5 credits per hectare. 

##### NDII

The Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) computation offers insight into plant canopies' water content. Using the openEO Algorithm Plaza, NDII service costs 4-8 credits per hectare.

##### Biomass

The Biomass service provided by the openEO Algorithm Plaza is a critical component in tracking and quantifying carbon capture in agriculture and natural vegetation. Users can use this service with approximately 20-40 credits per hectare.

##### CropSAR

The CropSAR service is a key service for monitoring agricultural conditions. An AI model which fills missing Sentinel-2 observations due to clouds based on Sentinel-1 radar observations. By doing so, more continuous vegetation properties monitoring can be performed. Users can use this service with approximately 40-60 credits per hectare.

title: "Credit Strength"
---

The following mentioned are among the popular services available in openEO algorithm plaza. Here we have presented an average credit strength for these services. Please note that depending on the time interval and area of interest, the credits can slightly vary.

The purpose of this document is to solely provide users with an assumption on how these credits work and their strength for varying services.

1. NDVI

    For the calculation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), you can acquire ~250 NDVI images, each with an area of 1 hectare, i.e. 1 NDVI image patch of 1 hectare cost 3-5 credits.

2. NDII

    Computation of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) provides the user with an indication of the water content in the plant canopies. A straightforward calculation of the NDII can be achieved from openEO algorithm plaza NDII service with the use of 4-8 credits per hectare area, i.e. you can use your 1000 credits for computing NDII in a given area of ~117 hectares.

3. Biomass

    The Biomass service provided by openEO algorithm plaza can be a critical component in tracking and quantifying carbon capture in agriculture and natural vegetation. Users can use this service with approximately 20-40 credits per hectare, i.e. ~33-hectare area with a total of 1000 credits.

4. CropSAR

    The operational agricultural monitoring can be a key use case for this service as it uses Sentinel-1 radar observations to augment those of Sentinel-2. By doing so, more continuous vegetation properties monitoring can be performed, including vegetation information for situations where these properties cannot be retrieved from Sentinel-2 observations due to cloud occurrence. Users can use this service with approximately 40-60 credits per hectare, i.e. ~20-hectare area with a total of 1000 credits.


::: {callout-note}

Though the required credit for direct download of the output data is two credits for all the services, it has a time limitation of 10 seconds to run the entire process. Otherwise, the download process will fail.

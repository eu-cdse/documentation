The following mentioned are among the popular services available in openEO algorithm plaza. Here we have presented an average credit strength for these services. Please note that depending on the time interval and area of interest, the credits can slightly vary.

The purpose of this document is to solely provide users with an assumption on how these credits work and their strength for varying services.

##### NDVI

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a key indicator of vegetation health. It is calculated by comparing the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs) in satellite imagery.
Calculating the NDVI of square hectare, costs 3-5 credits per hectare. 

##### NDII

The computation of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) offers insight into the water content in plant canopies. Using the openEO algorithm, plaza NDII service costs 4-8 credits per hectare.

##### Biomass

The Biomass service provided by the openEO algorithm plaza is a critical component in tracking and quantifying carbon capture in agriculture and natural vegetation. Users can use this service with approximately 20-40 credits per hectare.

##### CropSAR

The CropSAR service is a key service for monitoring argicultural conditions. An AI model which fills missing Sentinel-2 observation, due to clouds, based on Sentinel 1 radar observations. By doing so, more continuous vegetation properties monitoring can be performed. Users can use this service with approximately 40-60 credits per hectare.


::: {callout-note}

Though the required credit for direct download of the output data is two credits for all the services, it has a time limitation of 10 seconds to run the entire process. Otherwise, the download process will fail.

This documentation section demonstrates how to use the reporting function within the openEO algorithm plaza. Individuals using the platform can track the services they have used and see how credits have been deducted for each service. The purpose of this guide is to help users efficiently track and document their service consumption while also keeping an eye on their credit balance.

Please check that you are logged in to your account for accessing the reporting functionality. Once logged in, select the "Reporting" option from the navbar, that will take you to the screen shown in the figure below:

If you haven't executed anything yet, there may not be much information displayed on the screen. However, as you start utilizing openEO and the services on the plaza, the screen will populate with relevant data that can be visualized in the following manner:

1. Filtering Reports: You will have the option to filter the reports based on a specific time interval. This allows you to view the openEO usage and credit deductions within a desired timeframe, providing a more targeted analysis.
2. Credit Usage Display: A section will be available to display the credits used, showcasing both the synchronous and batch job execution methods. This information helps you understand how your credits are being utilized for different types of job executions. Hovering over the credit usage details will provide additional information on the specific service used.
3. Jobs List: The screen will include a list of the jobs that have been executed. This list provides a comprehensive overview of the services that have been utilized. Each job entry will typically include details such as job ID, execution time, and any relevant metadata associated with the job.

On the top right corner of the screen, you will notice an "Export" button. By clicking on this button, you will have the option to download the report in either PDF or CSV file format. This feature enables you to save and archive the report for future reference or share it with others as needed.

Next to the "Personal" section, you will find the "Service" tab, specifically designed for service providers to monitor and track reports on the services published by their organisation. If you haven't provided service, this tab will appear empty, as mentioned earlier. However, if you have published services, the page will populate with a similar layout. Additionally a "Service Execution" section is shown, displaying the number of times each service within your organization was executed.

Organisations are core elements of the openEO algorithm plaza Portal, as they are the entities that relate users, accesses, services, data, etc. One can think of an organisation as a company in most cases, although an individual can be a one-man organisation. This organisational concept allows users to manage shared services and allocate credits accordingly. Users can design their organisation to specific needs, whether for project collaborators, a particular team, or at the organisational level.

## Provide your organisation details

When you register in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, a personal organisation is already created for you. On your profile page within the openEO Algorithm Plaza, you'll find your organisation shown under the linked organisation section. Additionally, you can access the Organisation page by selecting the "Organisation" option in the sub-navigation. Here, you can both view and edit your organisation's details, which may include:

* Organisation name (mandatory)
* Organisation Identity registration (optional)
* Organisation Avatar / logo URL (optional)
* Organisation description (optional)
* Organisation website (optional)
* Terms of use URL (optional) and other “useful links” e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy, YouTube, and Support URLs
* Update button, disabled by default

## Invite Team members

A key aspect of this platform is the capability to invite colleagues, friends, or co-workers to join a shared organisation. 
You can invite new members to your organisation by clicking on the `INVITE MEMBER` button available within the `Team` sub-menu of your profile. This will prompt a form where you will have to provide some more information for adding a new user to your organization. This block contains the following fields:

* Email address (Mandatory)
* Role dropdown (Organisation owner or Developer).
* SEND button

The form should also disappear after successful submission.

Once you click on the `SEND` button, a message that the invitation was send will pop up at the top of the page. The invitee will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. 

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">

</div>

Once the invitation is accepted, the new member will be added to the organisation and will be able to access the organisation's resources.

## Accept the invitation

To be a part of an existing organisation, you need to be invited by the organisation owner or admin. As mentioned above, an invitation can be sent to any user within the platform. You will receive an email with the invitation link. We recommend you sign in first and then accept the invitation by simply confirming the link. When you click on the confirm invitation, you will see the following screen:

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="../_images/PlazaAcceptInvitation.PNG" width="300" height="300"  />
</div>


Once you click on the ```ACCEPT INVITATION``` button, you will be see a message that you have successfully accepted the invitation appearing at the top of the screen.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="../_images/PlazaAccepted.PNG"
width="450" height="100"  />
</div>

You can now close the invitation from the top right corner.

## Switch between organisation

Once you have accepted the invitation to join the organisation, upon returing to your profile, you'll find the organisation you have joined listed under the ```Linked organisation``` dropdown menu. To switch to the new organisation, simply select it from the dropdown menu and click on the ```SWITCH``` button.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="../_images/PlazaSwitchOrg.PNG" />
</div>


Once you switch the organisation, you'll be able to see all the team members and their roles. However, please note that if you have a *Developer* role, you won't be able to invite new members to your organisation. Only the *Organisation owner* will be able to invite new members to the organisation.

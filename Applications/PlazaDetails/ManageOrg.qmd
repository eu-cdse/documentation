Assuming that the user have already registered in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and have access to the openEO Algorithm Plaza. Upon checking their [profile](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/profile){target='_blank'}, they'll notice that a personal organization has been created.

The organisations are core elements of the openEO algorithm plaza, as they are the entities that relate users, services, openEO credits, and more. While organizations can encompass multiple users, here, even an individual can be viewed as an organization. This organisational concept allows users to manage shared services and distribute credits accordingly. Furthermore, these organisations can be tailor to suit specific requirements, whether for project collaborators, a particular team, or at the organizational level.

## Provide your organisation details

The organisation is displayed on the profile page within the openEO Algorithm Plaza under the linked organisation section. Additionally, the "Organization" option in the sub-navigation provides access to the Organization page. Here, users can view and edit the organisation's details, which may include:

* Organisation name (mandatory)
* Organisation Identity registration (optional)
* Organisation Avatar / logo URL (optional)
* Organisation description (optional)
* Organisation website (optional)
* Terms of use URL (optional) and other “useful links” e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy, YouTube, and Support URLs
* Update button, disabled by default

## Invite Team members

A key aspect of this platform is its capability to invite colleagues, friends, or co-workers to join a shared organization. New members can be invited to the organization by clicking on the `INVITE MEMBER` button available within the `Team` sub-menu of the profile. This action will prompt a form where additional information is required for adding a new user to the organization. This block contains the following fields:

* Email address (Mandatory)
* Role dropdown (Organisation owner or Developer).
* SEND button

The form should also disappear after successful submission.

Once clicked on the `SEND` button,  a message confirming that the invitation has been sent will pop up at the top of the page. The invitee will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">

</div>

Once the invitation is accepted, the new member will be added to the organisation and will be able to access the organisation's resources.

## Accept the invitation

To be a part of an existing organization, an invitation from the organization owner or admin is required. As mentioned earlier, an invitation can be sent to any user within the platform. Upon receiving an email with the invitation link, it is recommended to sign in first and then accept the invitation by confirming the link. Clicking on the confirmation link will lead to the following screen:

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="../_images/PlazaAcceptInvitation.PNG" width="300" height="300"  />
</div>


Upon clicking the ```ACCEPT INVITATION``` button, a message confirming successful acceptance of the invitation will appear at the top of the screen.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">

width="450" height="100"  />
</div>


## Switch between organisation

Once the invitation to join the organization has been accepted, upon returning to the profile, users will find the organization they have joined listed under the ```Linked organization``` dropdown menu. To switch to the new organization, select it from the dropdown menu and click on the ```SWITCH``` button.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">

</div>


Once the organization is switched, all team members and their roles will be visible. However, please note that users with a *Developer* role will not be able to invite new members to the organization. Only the *Organization owner* will have the ability to invite new members.

Being an online Application Programming Interface (API) and integrations, openEO algorithm plaza provides a self-service portal through which customers, internal staff, and external providers can interact, publish, and use integrations easily in one place. 
In general, because EO user and service provider platforms aggregate services and integrations from a range of providers, the selection is usually wider, and availability is higher than in vendor-specific online portals.
As an authenticated user using the openEO algorithm plaza, you should be able to view the advertised services.

* You will see:
  * A main list of all the services, ordered by popularity, paginated.
  * A text filter bar to filter through the existing services.
  * Attribute filtering (publisher, category, type).
  
* Each service will be visually represented on a card by:
  * A logo
  * The service’s title
  * The service’s short description
  * The service’s maturity level
  
* You can click on each service and be redirected to the service’s detail page.

Services can be executed through the tools that are provided by the different orchestrators. 
The table below shows a short summary of the different tools that are available for each orchestrator.

There are several ways to discover how a service can be executed. When publishing a service on the openEO algorithm plaza, a service provider can choose to provide the following information in the service details:

* An executable link which redirects the user to the online orchestrator's user interface. If this is the case, an **Access service** button will appear when opening an openEO algorithm plaza service.

* Sample code in the service description on how to execute a service. 

## Online user interface

Both orchestrators provide an online user interface where users can execute services directly in a web browser. 
Through these graphical user interfaces, users can execute, link, and configure different services. More information on the usage of the online applications is presented in the table below.

## Client libraries

openEO provides client libraries to support the creation and execution of JavaScript, Python and R services. The full client libraries documentation is available on the official openEO support pages:

* [JavaScript](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/JavaScript_Client/JavaScript.html){target="_blank"}
* [Python](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/Python_Client/Python.html){target="_blank"}
* [R](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/R_Client/R.html){target="_blank"}

The following example shows a code sample on how to execute a service through the openEO Python Client.

```python
import openeo

# Setup parameters
aoi = {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ],
            [
                5.178744792938232,
                51.24672597710759
            ],
            [
                5.185289382934569,
                51.24504696935156
            ],
            [
                5.18676996231079,
                51.245342479161295
            ],
            [
                5.187370777130127,
                51.24918393390799
            ],
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
date = '2020-06-01'

# Setup connection with OpenEO
eoconn = openeo.connect("https://openeo.vito.be").authenticate_oidc("egi")

# Create a processing graph from the BIOMASS process using an active openEO connection
taskmap = eoconn.datacube_from_process("taskmap_generate", namespace="https://openeo.vito.be/openeo/1.0/processes/u:EOplaza_tps/taskmap_generate", aoi=aoi,
                                       date=date)

# Execute the openEO request as a batch job
taskmap_job = taskmap.save_result(format='gtiff').send_job()
taskmap_job.start_and_wait().get_results()
```

To execute a service from the openEO algorithm plaza through one of the OpenEO client libraries, it is important to use the *datacube_from_process* function. 
This accepts the ID and namespace of the service. 
Both are made available in the service description on the openEO algorithm plaza. 
The full documentation on using the function is available on the official [openEO documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/datacube_construction.html#datacube-from-process){target="_blank"}.

More examples are available in the [openEO GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client/tree/master/examples){target="_blank"}.

## API

Both openEO provide a fully documented API as a more advanced way to integrate features of both orchestrators in any existing application or workflow. These APIs can also be used to execute openEO algorithm plaza services. The documentation of these services is available at:

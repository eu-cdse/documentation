Users can use the services offered in the openEO Algorithm Plaza to analyse their data. These services can be executed using the tools provided by openEO. Below is a concise overview of the various tools available:


| Tool | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| openEO Web Editor | A web-based interface for executing openEO processes. | 
| Command Line Interface (CLI)	 | Allows execution of openEO processes through the command line. | 
| Python Client | 	A Python library facilitating interaction with openEO services programmatically. | 
| R Client	 | An R library for integrating openEO services into R scripts. | 


Users have the flexibility to use their preferred tool to execute the services. Nonetheless, each service is equipped with a `Get Started` button within the plaza. This button offers available execution options for the service, such as:

* "Execute in Web Editor": Allows users to run the service in the online user interface.
* "See client examples": Provides code examples for programmatically executing the service using Python, R, or JavaScript.

There is a limitation when executing a service (User Defined Processes) in Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem, that it only works collection from 2017 or so onwards. Moreover, it is recommended to test it for multiple consecutive years.

## Online user interface

When user chose to execute the service in a web editor using `Execute in Web Editor` option, they are provided with an online user interface. Here users can execute services directly in a [web-editor](https://openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target='_blank'} by simply inputing the required parameters and running them. 

You can find the full documentation on how to use the web editor [in this section](../WebEditor.qmd)of the documentation. Below are some additional resources to help you get started with the web editor:

## Client libraries

Most of the services in the openEO Algorithm Plaza can be executed programmatically using the openEO client libraries. When publishing the service, the service provider are requested to provide code examples for executing the service using Python, R, or JavaScript. Therefore, when you chose the option to `See client examples`, you will be directed to the section that includes an executing examples.

Furthermore, openEO provides client libraries to support the creation and execution of JavaScript, Python and R services. The full client libraries documentation is available on the official openEO support pages:

* [JavaScript](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/JavaScript_Client/JavaScript.html){target="_blank"}
* [Python](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/Python_Client/Python.html){target="_blank"}
* [R](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/R_Client/R.html){target="_blank"}

The following example shows a code sample on how to execute a service through the openEO Python Client.

```python
import openeo

# Setup parameters
aoi = {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ],
            [
                5.178744792938232,
                51.24672597710759
            ],
            [
                5.185289382934569,
                51.24504696935156
            ],
            [
                5.18676996231079,
                51.245342479161295
            ],
            [
                5.187370777130127,
                51.24918393390799
            ],
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
date = '2020-06-01'

# Setup connection with OpenEO
eoconn = openeo.connect("https://openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu").authenticate_oidc("egi")

# Create a processing graph from the BIOMASS process using an active openEO connection
taskmap = eoconn.datacube_from_process("taskmap_generate", namespace="https://openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu/openeo/1.0/processes/u:123456/taskmap_generate", aoi=aoi,
                                       date=date)

# Execute the openEO request as a batch job
taskmap_job = taskmap.download('task.nc')

```

Furthermore, in the example above, you'll observe the usage of `datacube_from_process` function to execute the service. This function requires the ID and namespace of the service, both provided in the service description on the openEO Algorithm Plaza. For comprehensive documentation on using this function, please refer to [openEO documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/datacube_construction.html#datacube-from-process){target="_blank"}.


If you encounter any issues while executing a service, or if you have any questions, please feel free to raise questions in the [forum](https://forum.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"} directly.

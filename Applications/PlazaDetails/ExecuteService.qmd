title: "Execute a service"
---

Services can be executed through the tools that are provided by the different orchestrators. 
The table below shows a short summary of the different tools that are available for each orchestrator.

| OpenEO | ASB |
| --- | --- |
| Online user interface - web editor <br/> Client Libraries (JavaScript, Python, R) <br />API |	Online user interface <br /> ADES interface |

There are several ways to discover how a service can be executed. When publishing a service on the EOplaza, a service provider can choose to provide the following information in the service details:
* An executable link which redirects the user to the online orhcestrator's user interface. If this is the case, an **Access app** button will appear when opening an EOplaza service.
* Sample code in the service description on how to execute a service. 

## Online user interface

Both orchestrators provide an online user interface where users can execute services directly in a web browser. 
Through these graphical user interfaces, users can execute, link, and configure different services. More information on the usage of the online applications is presented in the table below.

## Client libraries

OpenEO provides client libraries to support the creation and execution of JavaScript, Python and R services. The full client libraries documentation is available on the official OpenEO support pages:
* [JavaScript](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/javascript/)
* [Python](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/python/)
* [R](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/r/ )

The following example shows a code sample on how to execute a service through the OpenEO Python Client.

```python
import openeo

# Setup parameters
aoi = {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ],
            [
                5.178744792938232,
                51.24672597710759
            ],
            [
                5.185289382934569,
                51.24504696935156
            ],
            [
                5.18676996231079,
                51.245342479161295
            ],
            [
                5.187370777130127,
                51.24918393390799
            ],
            [
                5.179324150085449,
                51.2498689148547
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
date = '2020-06-01'

# Setup connection with OpenEO
eoconn = openeo.connect("https://openeo.vito.be").authenticate_oidc("egi")

# Create a processing graph from the BIOMASS process using an active openEO connection
taskmap = eoconn.datacube_from_process("taskmap_generate", namespace="https://openeo.vito.be/openeo/1.0/processes/u:EOplaza_tps/taskmap_generate", aoi=aoi,
                                       date=date)

# Execute the OpenEO request as a batch job
taskmap_job = taskmap.save_result(format='gtiff').send_job()
taskmap_job.start_and_wait().get_results()
```

To execute a service from the EOplaza through one of the OpenEO client libraries, it is important to use the *datacube_from_process* function. 
This accepts the ID and namespace of the service. 
Both are made available in the service description on the EOplaza. 
The full documentation on using the function is available on the official [OpenEO documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/datacube_construction.html#datacube-from-process).

It is possible to combine the Python and R OpenEO libraries with the notebooks provided by PROBA-V MEP. 
Examples are available in the [OpenEO GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client/tree/master/examples).

## API

Both OpenEO and ASB provide a fully documented API as a more advanced way to integrate features of both orchestrators in any existing application or workflow. These APIs can also be used to execute EOPlaza services. The documentation of these services is available at:

| OpenEO | ASB |
|---|---|
| https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/api/reference.html | https://mep-wps.vgt.vito.be/ades/api/ |

The following example showcases how to use the OpenEO API to execute a synchronous request for the BioPAR service:

```curl
POST /openeo/1.0.0/result HTTP/1.1
Host: openeo.vito.be
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer basic//basic.cHJvag==
Content-Length: 4587
{
    "process": {
        "id": "biopar1",
        "process_graph": {
            "biopar1": {
                "process_id": "biopar",
                "namespace": "vito",
                "arguments": {
                    "bbox": {
                        "west": 5.15183687210083,
                        "east": 5.153381824493408,
                        "south": 51.18192559252128,
                        "north": 51.18469636040683,
                        "crs": "EPSG:4326"
                    },
                    "time_range": [
                        "2020-05-06",
                        "2020-05-30"
                    ]
                },
                "result": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this section, we aim to address the key aspects of managing your services on the openEO Algorithm Plaza.

## Upgrade your Service

Each service is given a maturity level based on the quality of the service. In order to upgrade the level of service, responsible user should improve their services and documentation in such a way that it meets the [criteria](ServiceMaturity.qmd) for the desired levels. Then a request can be made at our [help center](https://helpcenter.dataspace.copernicus.eu/hc/en-gb) for upgrading the service.


## Changing a service visibility to private

Changing the visibility of a service to private ensures that the service is not visible in the openEO algorithm plaza. 
This can be useful for fixing bugs, developing, and testing before publishing it to the marketplace.

Changing a service’s visibility can be done by selecting the specific service card from the **Services**. This will open the service details. Scroll down to the section to set the service’s visibility to private.

It is important to note that setting the visibility to private only hides the service in openEO algorithm plaza. 

## Remove a service 

Similar to making a service private, a user can remove it. You can simply click on the `REMOVE` button at the bottom of the service details page. A popup window will request your confirmation of deleting the service.
Clicking **YES** will remove it from the openEO algorithm plaza service catalogue and delete all of its related data.

It is important to note that removing the service from the openEO algorithm plaza does not remove it from the orchestrators. 
Users are still able to execute the service through the orchestrators. 
If you want to remove the service from the orchestrators, please follow the instructions below.

### Removing a service in the orchestrators

Removing a service from the orchestrators will disable its execution by any of the orchestrator’s users. openEO provides two ways to remove a service (also known as a user-defined process in openEO):

* **Using the OpenEO API**<br/>The process_graphs endpoint allows users to remove a service based on its ID. More information is available in the [official API documentation](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/api/reference.html#operation/delete-custom-process){target="_blank"}.

* **Using the openEO Python Client**<br/>The openEO Python Client supplies a delete function that can be executed for any user defined process that is managed by the authenticated user. More information is available in the [official Python Client documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.udp.RESTUserDefinedProcess.delete){target="_blank"}.

In this section, we aim to address the key aspects of managing services on the openEO Algorithm Plaza.

## Upgrade your Service

ach service is given a maturity level based on the quality of the service. To upgrade the level of service, the developer should improve their services and documentation so that they meet the [criteria](ServiceMaturity.qmd) for the desired levels. Then a request can be made at our [help center](https://helpcenter.dataspace.copernicus.eu/hc/en-gb) for upgrading the service.


## Changing a service visibility to private

Changing the visibility of a service to private ensures that the service is not visible in the EOplaza. 
This can be useful for fixing bugs, developing, and testing before publishing it to the marketplace.

Changing a service’s visibility can be done by selecting the specific service card from the **Services**. Scroll down to the section to set the service’s visibility to private.

## Remove a service 

To remove a service from the openEO Algorithm Plaza, users can follow the steps below:

* Navigate to the service details page by clicking on the service card from the **Services** page.
* Scroll down to the bottom of the service details page.
* Click on the `REMOVE` button.
* Confirm the deletion by clicking **YES** in the popup window.

It is important to note that removing the service from the EOplaza does not remove it from the orchestrators. 
Users are still able to execute the service through the orchestrators. 
To remove the service from the orchestrators, please follow the instructions below.

### Removing a service in the orchestrators

Removing a service from the orchestrators deactivates its use. openEO provides two ways to remove a service (also known as a user-defined process in openEO):

* **Using the OpenEO API**<br/>The process_graphs endpoint allows users to remove a service based on its ID. More information is available in the [official API documentation](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/api/reference.html#operation/delete-custom-process){target="_blank"}.

* **Using the openEO Python Client**<br/>The openEO Python Client provides a delete function that can be used for any User Defined Process the authenticated user manages. More information is available in the [official Python Client documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.udp.RESTUserDefinedProcess.delete){target="_blank"}.

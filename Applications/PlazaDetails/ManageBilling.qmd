During the execution of our openEO algorithm plaza services, credits will be deducted for each execution. 
You can manage your credits directly on the openEO algorithm plaza by clicking the ```Billing``` menu item. This redirects to the billing page where you can see:

* An overview of your current credit score
* A Call to Action (CTA) button to top up your credits 
* A selection menu to select a subscription plan 
* An overview of your financial transactions

## Monitor available credits

To visualize available credits in your account, first, you must sign in. If you don't have login credentials, please [```Register```](CreateAccount.qmd).
    
Once logged in, click on the Billing tab that leads to a page showing your available credits, followed by additional information on subscription.

> The credits that are shown are shared amongst your organization. If you are a member of multiple organizations, navigate to the [profile page](ManageProfile.qmd) to change your `Billing Organization`.

## Credit's strength

Credits are deducted based on the chosen services and spatial extent.
The amount will vary depending on the processing complexity and time required for each type of service.
Detailed examples of some well-known services and how they fit into the 3000 free credits can further be found [here](Strength.qmd).

Moreover, every user is provided with 3000 credits each month, with which they can execute multiple services.

 
## Adding credits

Based on the required credits for executing a service, if you think your available credits are insufficient, there are two ways you can replenish the credits available in your account. 
You can purchase them as a one-time purchase or buy a subscription. 


* **Purchase Credits**

  You can add/purchase a limited credit amount through a one-time payment by clicking on ```Add credits``` button next to the credit score. After choosing among the different credit packs, you are redirected to a payment service to continue payment.

   > Credits packs will be made available soon.

    Once we receive the payment, your credits will be updated. 

* **Credit Subscription**

    The other way is by selecting one of the available subscription plans. Once you click on the "Start subscription" button, you will be redirected to the payment page for your selected subscription plan, where you can provide the payment details for recurring payments. 


   > Subscriptions will be made available soon.

    At any time, you can change or cancel an active subscription. The current credits will be kept, and you will receive a new amount after the successful payment of the new subscription plan.

## Request for statement

If you want to request a statement regarding your credit expenditure, you can [create a ticket](https://helpcenter.dataspace.copernicus.eu/hc/en-gb){target="_blank"} with your username, email, and the time interval for the requested information.

title: "openEO Web Editor"
---

The openEO Web Editor is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the openEO API and perform various tasks related to Earth observation data processing. It provides a user-friendly interface for users who are not familiar with a programming language to carry out several Earth Observation data processing tasks, such as querying available data, defining processing workflows, executing processes, and visualising the results. It allows users to build complex processing chains by connecting different processing steps as building blocks and provides options to specify parameters and input data for each step. 

The openEO Web Editor can be accessed via [https://openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu/](https://openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"}. Even without logging in, users have the ability to retrieve information on available collections, processes, User Defined Functions(UDF) Runtimes, and the options for exporting files. Additionally, users can create openEO process graphs, however, log in is necessary to execute them.

## Getting Started

Upon initial access to the provided link, users are presented with the following screen which is further explained below in refernce to the given numbering:

![](_images/webeditor/webeditor.png)

1. **Service Offering**
   
    The sidebar offers users the ability to navigate through the available collections, processes, UDF Runtimes and Export file formats. At the top of the sidebar, there is a search feature that allows for direct searching. 

    Within the *Collections* section, users can access a comprehensive list of data collections available in the backend through openEO. Clicking on any of these collections will bring up a detailed metadata window.

    Under the *Processes* section, users can find a comprehensive list of openEO processes specifically designed for Earth Observation processing. These processes operate on individual values within an array, accepting and returning a single value.

    The *UDF Runtimes* section provides information on the available environments or platforms where User Defined Functions (UDFs) can be executed. Currently, the python runtime is available during this stage of development.

    In the *Export File Formats* section, users are guided on the supported output formats within openEO. Clicking on each format provides a detailed summary of its associated parameters.

2. **Help**
    
    The *Help* icon at the top of the screen will provide you with a short tour of the main section of the editor. 

3. **Wizard**

    The *Wizard* is an experimental feature that will help you to create openEO processes in a simple way for some common use cases.

4. **Server**

    The Server icon will pop up a window giving the user detailed information on the server used for processing the created processes. 

5. **Guest**

    The *Guest* naming will be replaced with your username when logged in. The dropdown will provide with an option to Log in.

6. **Features**

    The basic functionalities that can be handy when creating the processes in openEO Web Editor is available in this row. These functionalities includes creating a new script, importing processes from external sources, exporting in another programming language, validating processes on the server side, editing process metadata, adding parameters, etc. 

7. **Process Editor**
   
   This is the editor for the processes. We recommend to work in "**Visual Model**" mode, where you can create processing chains simply by adding collections and processes and connecting them with each other. The "**Code**" mode allows to see the generated JSON process, which is usually only needed if you want to run the process using another client library such as Python or R.

   The area on it's right will later be used for previewing collections or inspecting the results of batch jobs, web services or other computations. It will also be used to display log messages, if available.

8.  **Log in**

    As previously mentioned, it is necessary to log in to interact with the server. A new window will appear when attempting to log in, as demonstrated below. While other options are sometimes available, the recommended authentication choice is the "Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem". For further information regarding various authentication methods or to seek assistance, you can always click on the "help" option at the top or contact us.

## Create a workflow

Based on their applications user can build their model by simple drag and drop method. Some processes may necessitate input parameters, which must be carefully considered. As an illustration, we present a simple case of creating a workflow to calculate NDVI using the Sentinel 2 L2A collection. Three main steps involved in using openEO for Earth Observation data processing is shown below. 

1. Load Collection 
   
    a. To start a task within the openEO web editor, your first step involves ensuring you have the necessary dataset for the analysis. Thus, you must ensure the required dataset exists within the openEO database. You can do this by exploring/searching the list of available datasets from the sidebar of the interface.
    
    b. In our example, we want to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), so the Sentinel 2 L2A collection will be used. Once you find this collection, the next step is to drag and drop it into the Process Editor for further operations.
        
    ![](_images/webeditor/drag_collection.png)


    Now, once you load collection, there are several parameters you need to specify, including the area of interest, the temporal extent, and the selection of bands. When you click on the collection, a window pops up, where you can define the necessary parameters for subsequent processing. 
    
    c. To specify the area of interest, you can choose between generating a bounding box or importing your spatial extent by dragging and dropping GeoJSON or KML files onto the map view. Here, we've provided an example involving a bounding box. There is also an option to "No filter", that will include all the data in the datacube.

    d. Another parameter is Temporal extent, that imits the data to load from the collection to the specified  temporal interval.

    ![](_images/webeditor/define_temporal.png)

    e. In our case, for NDVI calculation, we have specifically chosen the Red band (B04) and the Near-Infrared (NIR) band (B08). 
        
    ![](_images/webeditor/define_bands.png)

2. Apply Processes
    
    Eventually, the next step involves implementing essential processes, ranging from straightforward operations like adding bands to more complex tasks such as importing or defining user-defined functions (UDFs). 

    In this task, we're using a specific process called `reduce_dimension` as a key part of the operation. This process helps us simplify our collection: first, we use it to reduce temporal dimension and second, to deal with the various bands.
            
    ![](_images/webeditor/reduce_dimension.png)

    In the initial process, the `reduce_dimension` algorithm eliminates the temporal dimension by selecting the maximum value using the max function.
            
    <centre><img src="_images/webeditor/temporal_reducer.png"  width="80%" height="60%"></centre>

    Following this, the same `reduce_dimension` is utilised to reduce the band dimension after executing a series of addition, subtraction, and division operations necessary for the NDVI calculation.

3. Select a format

    As a final step in the workflow creation is to select the output format. 
        
    ![](_images/webeditor/save_process.png)

    Since our application involves simple NDVI calculation, we want to save it as a GeoTiff. 

    ![](_images/webeditor/save_as_gtiff.png)


## Execute the workflow

To complete the data analysis process, the final step involves executing the created workflow. This can be done in two ways: synchronously or through batch job-based method. Synchronous method allows the user to download the data directly, whereas batch job-based method enables the user to execute process as a batch. The choice of method depends on the user's preference and the size of the dataset. 

![](_images/webeditor/execute_jobs.png)

In the above figure, the red box includes the two methods possible for executing the process. In this example, I used the synchronus method by directly clicking on *Run now*, which popped up a box in the bottom right corner. 

Once the execution process is completed, the result is automatically saved locally. It can also be visualised in the parallel window as shown in the image below:

![](_images/webeditor/webeditor_result.PNG)


Furthermore, if you have created Batch Job, you can monitor its action from the same window. 


## Data Download using Wizard

The Wizard feature at the top navigation bar allows easy creation of process graphs for common, basic use cases without having to drag and drop processes as done earlier. 

:::{callout-warning}

This feature is experimental and it's not guaranteed that the generated process graphs are fully functional.

:::

At the time of this documentation release, two cases are currently available through the Wizard feature: direct downloading of data for a selected area and downloading computed spectral indices as shown in the figure below:

![](_images/webeditor/wizard.png)

You have the option to choose any one of them and enter the necessary parameters as instructed. This method makes the task considerably more straightforward than the previously mentioned workflow creation approach, as the structure is already established and you only need to input the essential parameters.

## Monitor the workflow

When a batch job is created, openEO's logs feature can help with *monitoring and debugging* of workflows. The back-end typically uses this to dump information during data processing that may be relevant for the user (e.g. warnings, resource stats, …). Like many other processes, job logs can be visualized programmatically as well as in the web editor. 

As shown in the following image, you have the option to access the job logs by clicking on the icon located next to the job ID at the bottom of the interface.

![](./_images/webeditor/joblist.png)

When clicking on it, a pane emerges on the right, as shown below:

![](./_images/webeditor/joblogs.png)

Moreover, users can use openEO processes like `inspect`, this will allow you to log your own information to be displayed in the job logs.

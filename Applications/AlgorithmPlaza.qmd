The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem offers a openEO algorithm plaza for sharing openEO workflows for Earth Observation (EO) data processing. The plaza therefore enhances algorithm reusibility which is a cornerstone of the FAIR principles. Assuming familiarity with EO data and [openEO](../APIs/openEO/openEO.qmd) concepts, this section of the documentation acts as a beginners guide for sharing algorithms.

The [openEO Algorithm Plaza](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"} is a marketplace where various EO algorithms are shared a openEO process graphs.

Within the platform, the hosted algorithms can be used through user interfaces or APIs. Users can seamlessly onboard their algorithms on the openEO Algorithm Plaza for further exposure to a large audience.

## Overview 

The marketplace showcases a diverse catalogue of EO services from various providers. These services are classified based on their maturity levels, which indicates the quality and reliability of the service.

Each service has its dedicated page providing detailed information including; the methodology, expected results, and service execution instructions.


## What is a service?

The openEO Algorithm Plaza offers a wide range of EO workflows as services. These services can range from simple computations like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to more complex algorithms. 

In addition to providing access to the available services, the marketplace also supports users in showcasing their algorithms. To register an algorithm on the marketplace, it must be built as openEO UDP. For more information on openEO user-defined processes, visit the openEO [UDP](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/udp.html){target="_blank"}.

Once an algorithm is exposed as a service, other users can readily access and use it for their workflows. 

## Service maturity levels

To ensure quality control across the various services offered in the openEO algorithm plaza, the platform assigns a maturity level to them. This level indicates what end users can expect from the services:

* Validation of the result ensures the accuracy and reliability of the outcomes.
* Stability gives an idea on how well the service performs under different conditions. 
* Scalability informs users on how the algorithms performance is affected by an increasing amounts of data or users. 
* Documentation provides detailed information about the service, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and how to use it.

Based on these criteria, services are classified into five maturity levels: Prototype, Incubating, Verified, Validated, and Operational.

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Prototype**_ | Service is provided ‘as-is’, with a short description and possibly a reference to what is implemented. |
| _**Incubating**_ | The service is documented with example requests (sets of parameters) and the corresponding output, as well as the resources required to generate that output. |
| _**Verified**_ | The service is labelled verified based on its software readiness and verification that validation reports are not required. |
| _**Validated**_ | The service is labelled validated when the validation reports in addition to the software readiness is verified by the openEO Algorithm Plaza team. |
| _**Operational**_ | The service has been shown to be fit for larger scale production and integration in operational systems. Rules for estimating resource usage are available, or a unit cost is provided. (€ per hectare, € per request, etc.) |

> Detailed descriptions of the criteria for each maturity level are explained [here](PlazaDetails/ServiceMaturity.qmd).

For more information on managing services, please refer to the [Manage your services guide](PlazaDetails/ManageService.qmd).

Once familiar with the concepts used in the openEO Algorithm Plaza, individuals can start to explore the platform.

## Interested in using or publishing services?

Users can either use an existing service or publish their algorithms. Below is a non-extensive list of considerations to take when sharing a service.

### Managing your account

Executing the available services and features within the openEO Algorithm Plaza, requires logging in.  
New users can [register](../Registration.qmd) for one.

###### Step 1: Manage your Profile 

Additional information regarding updating profile settings can be accessed by selecting the avatar in the top right corner of the openEO Algorithm Plaza portal. This action will redirect users to a page featuring options like Overview, Team, and Organization in a sub-navigation menu.
        
![](_images/PlazaOrganization.png)

The **Overview** section presents profile details such as name, email, and affiliated organization. These details can be updated by clicking the `MANAGE` button. Meanwhile, in the **Team** sub-menu, a list of all organization members is displayed. This list can also be accessed by clicking the `VIEW TEAM` button at the bottom left of the overview sub-menu. Further information on team management can be found [here](PlazaDetails/ManageOrg.qmd). Lastly, within **Organisation** sub-menu, organization information such as name, email address, website, VAT number, and more can be viewed and modified.


###### Step 2: Manage your Organisation

Each registered user acts as a personal organization; details can be modified as discussed earlier in Step 1. However, this step 2 could helpful when working with multiple individuals or being part of multiple organizations. Organizations allow collaboration with other users, facilitating the sharing of billing and service accounts. For more information on managing the organization, please refer to the [organisation's documentation](PlazaDetails/ManageOrg.qmd) of the openEO Algorithm Plaza.

###### Step 3: Check your Credits

Using any openEO processes, including those offered as services in this marketplace, consumes a certain amount of credits. Credits are crucial in executing openEO processes. Notably, these credits are shared among organisations. Whenever a service or a supported processing platform is executed, credits from the shared pool cover the resource consumption.

This marketplace simplifies credit management, allowing users to monitor their account's full out. The credit can be monitored under the [`Billing`](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/billing){target="_blank"} section. Moreover, every user is provided with 4000 free openEO credits each month, with which they can execute multiple services.

Credits are deducted based on the chosen services. The amount will vary depending on the processing complexity and CPU time required for each type of service. Detailed examples of the credit usage of well known services can be found [here](PlazaDetails/Strength.qmd).

If the available credits are insufficient or depleted, users can [create a ticket](https://helpcenter.dataspace.copernicus.eu/hc/en-gb){target="_blank"} with their username and registered email for further support and guidance.


### Executing a services

Once sufficient credits are available, users can begin using the services. Any service can be chosen by simply clicking on the respective service card.

Clicking on any of these services, redirects users to the service details page. Here, information about the service, including a general description and execution instructions, can be found. For more information on how to execute a service, please refer to the [Execute a service](PlazaDetails/ExecuteService.qmd) page.

### Publishing a services

Every user has the choice to onboard their services as an individual or as part of a group organisation. 

##### Publish a algorithm

To publish a service on marketplace, the algorithm must be built using openEO. This ensures that users can take full advantage of plaza's features such as accounting and reporting, as well as the ability to execute services directly through the web editor. 

For more information on how to publish a service, please refer to the [Publish a service](PlazaDetails/PublishService.qmd) page.

##### Manage a service

Managing a services in this marketplace is a simple and straightforward process. Users can edit or delete services, as well as hide or show them in the plaza's catalogue. For detailed instructions on managing a service, please refer to the [manage your service](PlazaDetails/ManageService.qmd) page.

The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem offers a openEO algorithm plaza for sharing openEO workflows for EO data processing. The plaza therefore enhances algorithm reusibility which is a cornerstone of the FAIR principles. Assuming, the familiarity with EO data and [openEO](../APIs/openEO/openEO.qmd) concepts, this section of the documentation acts as a beginners guide for sharing algorithms.

The [openEO Algorithm Plaza](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"} is a marketplace, to showcase various Earth Observation (EO) algorithms represented as openEO process graphs. 

Within the platform, the hosted algorithms can be used through user interfaces or APIs. Users can seamlessly onboard their algorithms on the openEO Algorithm Plaza for further exposure to a large audience.

## Overview 

The marketplace showcase a diverse catalogue of EO services from various providers. These services are classified based on their maturity levels, which indicate the quality and reliability of the service.

Each service has its dedicated page providing detailed information. The information includes the methodology, expected results, and service execution instructions.


## What is a service?

openEO Algorithm Plaza offers a wide range of workflows in Earth Observation termed as services. These services can ranging from simple computations like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to more complex algorithms that utilize machine learning and multiple parameters. 

In addition to providing access to available services, the marketplace also supports users in showcasing their algorithms. To advertise an algorithms on the marketplace, they must be built using openEO. Visit the openEO [UDP](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/udp.html){target="_blank"} for more information on openEO user-defined-processes.

Once an algorithm is exposed as a service, other users readily access and use it for their own workflows. In order to favor the reusibility, it's important to  consider audience when preparing them. Especially for non-scientific users; you might want to avoid complex options that are difficult to understand.

## Service maturity levels

To ensure quality control across the various services offered in the openEO algorithm plaza, the platform assigns a maturity level to them. This level indicates what end users can expect from the services with in terms of:

* Validation of the results: That ensures the accuracy and reliability of the outcomes.
* Stability: Idea of how well the service performs under different conditions. 
* Scalability: Refers to the ability of the algorithm to handle increasing amounts of data or users without significant performance degradation.
* Documentation: The availability of detailed information about the service, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and how to use it.

Based on these criteria, services are classified into five maturity levels: Prototype, Incubating, Verified, Validated, and Operational.

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Prototype**_ | Service is provided ‘as-is’, with a short description and possibly a reference to what it tries to implement. |
| _**Incubating**_ | Quality of the service is documented with example requests (sets of parameters) and the corresponding output, as well as the resources required to generate that output. Allowing interested users to self-assess whether this service is suitable for usage. |
| _**Verified**_ | The service is labelled verified based on its software readiness and irrelevance to the scientific validation report. |
| _**Validated**_ | The service is validated, and validation reports are available in addition to being verified.
| _**Operational**_ | The service has been shown to be fit for larger scale production and integration in operational systems. Rules for estimating resource usage are available, or a unit cost is established. (€ per hectare, € per request, etc.) |

> Detailed descriptions of the criteria for each maturity level are explained [here](PlazaDetails/ServiceMaturity.qmd).

For more information on dealing with the services, please refer to the [Manage your services guide](PlazaDetails/ManageService.qmd).

Once you are familiar with the concepts used in the openEO Algorithm Plaza, you can begin to explore the platform.

## Interested in using or publishing services?

As a user, you have the option to either use an existing service or publish your own algorithms. Here, we have provided a list of important steps to consider when using or sharing a service. It's worth noting that this list is not exhaustive and additional steps may be required based on your specific needs.

### Managing your account

You can explore the available services and features within the openEO Algorithm Plaza. However, to use them, you must be logged in. Nevertheless, if you still need to register, you can follow the registration process mentioned [here](../Registration.qmd).

###### Step 1: Manage your Profile 

You can find more information on updating your profile settings once you click on your avatar in the top right corner of the openEO Algorithm Plaza portal. This takes you to a page with options like Overview, Team, and Organisation in a sub-navigation menu.
        
![](_images/PlazaOrganization.png)

The **Overview** section presents your profile details, such as your name, email, and affiliated organisation which you can update by clicking the `MANAGE` button. Whereas, the **Team** sub-menu will show you a list of all the members of your organisation. You can also reach this list by clicking the `VIEW TEAM` button at the left-bottom of the overview sub-menu. You can find more information team management in the [here](PlazaDetails/ManageOrg.qmd). From the **Organisation** sub-menu, you can view and modify your organisation's information, including its name, email address, website, VAT number, and more.

###### Step 2: Manage your Organisation

Each registered user acts as a personal organisation; you can modify its details as discussed in Step 1. However, this step is helpful when working with multiple individuals or being part of multiple organisations. Organisations allow collaboration with other users, facilitating the sharing of billing and service accounts. For more information on managing your organisation, please refer to the [organisation's documentation](PlazaDetails/ManageOrg.qmd) of the openEO Algorithm Plaza.

###### Step 3: Check your Credits

Using any openEO processes, including those offered as services in this marketplace, consumes a certain amount of credits. Credits are crucial in executing openEO processes, serving as the main currency for accessing services and processing resources. Notably, these credits are shared among organisations. Whenever a service or a supported processing platform is executed, credits from the shared pool cover the resource consumption.

This marketplace simplifies credit management, allowing users to monitor their account's credits easily. You can check your openEO credit under the [`Billing`](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/billing){target="_blank"} section. Moreover, every user is provided with 4000 credits each month, with which they can execute multiple services.

Credits are deducted based on the chosen services and spatial extent.The amount will vary depending on the processing complexity and time required for each type of service. Detailed examples of some well-known services and how they fit into the 4000 free credits can further be found [here](PlazaDetails/Strength.qmd).

If you think your available credits are insufficient or you run out of credits, you can [create a ticket](https://helpcenter.dataspace.copernicus.eu/hc/en-gb){target="_blank"} with your username, email for further support and guidance.


### Executing a services

As you have sufficient credits, you can start using the services available in the catalogue page. You can chose any service you want by simply clicking on the service card.

When you click on any of these services, you will be redirected to the service details page. Here, you can find information about the service such as a general description and instructions on how to execute the service. For more information on how to execute a service, please refer to the [Execute a service](PlazaDetails/ExecuteService.qmd) page.

### Publishing a services

Every user have the choice to onboard their services as an individual or as part of a group organisation. 

##### Publish your algorithm

To publish your service on marketplace, the algorithm must be built using one of the supported processing platforms(currently we only support openEO as orchestrator). This ensures that users can take full advantage of plaza's features, such as accounting and reporting, as well as the ability to execute services directly through the web editor. 

For more information on how to publish a service, please refer to the [Publish a service](PlazaDetails/PublishService.qmd) page.

##### Manage your service

Managing your services in this marketplace is a simple process. You can edit or delete services, as well as hide or show them in the plaza's catalogue. For detailed instructions on how to manage a service, please refer to the [manage your service](PlazaDetails/ManageService.qmd) page.

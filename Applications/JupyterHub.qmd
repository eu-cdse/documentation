JupyterLab is an advanced interactive development environment (IDE) that offers a flexible and feature-rich interface for working with notebooks, code, and data. It surpasses the Classic Jupyter Notebook Interface, providing a modern and comprehensive user experience. JupyterLab allows users to organize their workspaces using a flexible layout system with panels, views, and tabs for various activities. It supports various document formats, including notebooks, text files, code files, and markdown files. With its modular and extensible architecture, JupyterLab enables customization through extensions, additional functionalities, and integration with external tools. It enhances the user experience with features like a file browser, command palette, debugger, and console, making it a versatile tool for interactive data exploration, analysis, and scientific computing.

## Jupyter Notebook

Classic Jupyter Notebook Interface serve as an accessible entry point for both non-programmers and developers who want to quickly prototype their EO data processing. They provide a user-friendly interface, integrating well with Python SDK services like Sentinel Hub and OpenEO. Each Notebook has direct access to the EO Data repository, and example notebooks are available to facilitate data interaction. To handle tool dependencies and library versions, multiple notebook kernels are provided and regularly updated with the provided samples. This eliminates the need for users to handle dependency installations, enabling immediate prototyping without technical obstacles.


## Notebook flavors

When you log in to JupyterLab you are presented with a choice of 3 flavors of the Jupyter instances: Small, Medium and Large.
The size of the instance is determined by number of resources available to the notebook kernels run by the user - CPU cores and memory.
All flavors are suitable for performing typical tasks and will be capable of running all samples provided in /samples folder.
To ensure fair use of resources by the CDSE users, it is recommended to start with the Small flavor and switch to a bigger only when you experience issues with kernel crashing due to the lack of available memory.

## JupyterLab User Interface

Once you have successfully signed in, you will be presented with a launcher that offers various Python environments to work in, including Python 3, Geo science, OpenEO, and Sentinel Hub. Each environment is equipped with specific Python packages tailored to different requirements. You can choose to run your code either in a notebook or a console, depending on your preference. Additionally, the launcher provides options to create text files, markdown files, or Python files, allowing you to work with different types of documents as needed.

1. Main Work Area:
    The main work area in JupyterLab is the central portion of the interface where users perform their tasks. It consists of tabs representing open documents like notebooks, code files, and markdown files. These tabs can be arranged and docked within the work area, allowing users to customize their workspace to suit their needs and preferences.

2. Sidebar:
    The sidebar, located on the left side of the interface, provides additional functionality and information. It houses various panels, including a file browser for easy navigation through files and folders, a list of running kernels and terminals, and a table of contents for quick access to different sections of a notebook or document.

3. Launcher:
    The launcher is a central component that enables users to create new documents and launch different activities. Users can access other useful activities such as a command palette for executing commands, a file finder for quickly locating specific files, and a help panel for accessing documentation and assistance.

4. Menu Bar:
    The menu bar, located at the top of the interface, provides a set of menus with various options. Users can perform file operations, edit documents, configure the appearance and behavior of JupyterLab, manage kernels for code execution, and access other advanced features.

5. Contextual Tabs:
    Contextual tabs are dynamic and appear top of each notebook. These tabs provide relevant options and settings specific to the selected item, allowing users to perform actions and configurations directly within the interface.

Users can drag files from the file browser and drop them into notebooks or code files to import them seamlessly. Additionally, cells within a notebook can be rearranged by simply dragging and dropping them to different positions, facilitating the organization and structuring of notebook content.

These components collectively form the JupyterLab user interface, providing users with a flexible and customizable workspace for working with notebooks, code, and data. 

## Creating and Managing Notebooks

By default, sample notebooks are provided in the folder samples. 

To create a notebook in JupyterLab, you can easily select your desired kernel from the Notebook section in the launcher. Simply click on the kernel you want, and a new notebook named "Untitled. ipynb" will be created. If you wish to rename the notebook, you can do so by right-clicking on the notebook name in the sidebar and selecting the "rename" option. This gives your notebook a more meaningful and descriptive name for better organisation and clarity.

## Installing additional packages

You can install additional Python packages if necessary. This can be done both from the Notebook Terminal, which is located in the Launcher tab or within a Notebook cell. For e.g.:

::: {.panel-tabset}

# Terminal

`pip install required_package`

# Notebook

`!pip install required_package`

:::


## Markdown and Rich Text

If you prefer to work with a separate file, you can create a new Markdown (.md) or text (.txt) from the launcher or right click on the side bar and New file. Open the file and start writing your Markdown content using the Markdown syntax. Once you've written your content, you can save the file and preview it by double-clicking on it in the file browser, which will open a preview pane showing the rendered Markdown.

Alternatively, you can include Markdown and rich text directly within Notebooks. In a notebook, you can create a new cell and change its type to "Markdown" using the cell type dropdown in the toolbar or by pressing  `M`. Then, you can write your Markdown content in the cell using the Markdown syntax. To preview the rendered Markdown, you can either run the cell by pressing `Shift` + `Enter`, or use the "Preview" option from the cell's context menu to see the rendered content without executing the cell's code.

## Collaboration and Sharing

JupyterLab allows collaborative work with the functionality to share it with multiple users. They can edit and view the same notebooks or projects in real-time. It also offers various sharing options, including exporting notebooks to different formats (HTML, PDF, Markdown) and publishing them on platforms like GitHub or JupyterHub. These features empower users to easily share their work, communicate findings, and collaborate with a broader audience, promoting efficient collaboration and seamless knowledge dissemination..

## Basic notebook commands

Working with a Notebook is pretty convenient and the supporting text should enable a quick understanding of the presented code. Some basic Notebook commands are listed below:

| Keyboard Shortcut | Command                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Ctrl + Enter      | Run cell                         |
| A                 | Insert cell above current cell    |
| B                 | Insert cell below current cell    |
| C                 | Copy cell code                   |
| V                 | Paste cell code                  |
| DD                | Delete selected cell             |
| M                 | Change cell to Markdown (text) mode |


## Storage

When you start the notebook, in the file navigation pane (the sidebar - #2) you will see three folders:

* `mystorage`
* `samples`

> The availability of all other folders will be limited to your current session only. See the next chapter on more information on session persistence.

### `mystorage`

This is a persistent storage with 10GB of space, which is automatically created for each user during the first login to JupyterLab.
The storage is hosted in the CloudFerro cloud and can be used to save notebooks between the sessions, store the results or uploaded data files.
This storage area is preserved when you logout and the Jupyter kernel is shut down due to inactivity.
It will be kept for up to 15 days from your last login, and you will receive a notification to log in to JupyterLab to reset the timer and keep the data preserved.
If you do not log in, then after 15 days your files will be deleted from CloudFerro cloud storage.

### `samples`

These folders are recreated with every start of the Jupyter kernel.
The `samples` folder is always up-to-date with the latest version of notebooks.
If you make changes to the samples please make sure to save the updated notebook in the `mystorage` area to make sure you can use it when you get back after period of incativity.

## Session persistence

The Jupyter instance will be running as long as you interact with it, and will be kept alive for another 8 hours after your last activity.
After this time the instance will be shut-off and you will need to launch it during the next log in.
All data saved in `mystorage` will be preserved but all other files will be deleted and additional packages (dependencies) which were installed using pip need to be reinstalled.



## Tips and tricks

### Switching from Jupyter Lab to Classic Jupyter Notebook Interface

If you would like to switch to the  Classic Jupyter Notebook Interface, you can modify the URL in your home directory. Simply change the last part of the URL address from "lab" to "tree".
For example, you can change `https://jupyterhub.dataspace.copernicus.eu/user/username/lab/` to `https://jupyterhub.dataspace.copernicus.eu/user/username/tree/`. This way, you can easily access the notebook interface if desired.

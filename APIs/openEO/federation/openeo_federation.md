# Copernicus dataspace Ecosystem openEO federation

The openEO standard offers a unique capability to provide access to datasets and processing capacity beyond the offering of CDSE.
This gives you a single endpoint and interface for your workflows, avoiding the need to register with multiple platforms and
study their APIs and offerings. This is referred to as the openEO federation, and is offered through a this endpoint:

https://openeofed.dataspace.copernicus.eu

This capability is currently in a phase where we encourage early adopters and projects with specific needs to try it out.
It has already been extensively tested by users of other projects, but the configuration in the CDSE is new and thus we 
offer it as a 'beta' service at first, allowing us to still make changes to the configuration based on user feedback.

When using the federated endpoint, you will be asked to give consent for basic user information to be shared with the other providers
that make up the federation, as well as to accept the terms and conditions. These external providers all comply with the 
regulations of the federation, but are not necessarily part of the CDSE service. You can withdraw your consent at any time, via
your CDSE account dashboard.

## Federation credit usage

The use of processing capacity in the federation is likely to lead to credit consumption, that will be reported in the 
openEO algorithm plaza dashboards. External providers will allow a limited amount of credits, just like the public service.
Usage of those external providers will not lead to a reduction in credits of the public service.

title: Processes
---

The openEO project defines a large number of processes, which can be found at [https://processes.openeo.org](https://processes.openeo.org).
Given the multitude of processes, it is necessary to define a subset of processes (known as a profile) that must be implemented on each backend to ensure a certain level of interoperability.

In addition to the general openEO Processes specification and their [Processes Profiles](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/profiles/processes.html), the CDSE openEO federation requires the implementation of an additional Process profile, namely *L2P: Required - openEO*.
This requires one of the following openEO profiles *L2A: Recommended (Raster)* or *L2B: Recommended (Vector)*.
Additionally, there are two openEO Platform-specific profiles with additional requirements: *L3P: Advanced - openEO * and *L4P: Complete - openEO Platform*.

::: {.callout-note}

Some processes are marked as "experimental" in the openEO Processes specification. These refer to processes or features in the testing phase and are subject to significant changes. Users are encouraged to try these processes and provide feedback but should refrain from using them in production.

### Requirements per Profile

The profiles below only contain the requirements that are not covered by their corresponding openEO profiles.

Although in the openEO Profiles experimental processes shall only lead to a "warning", experimental processes in profiles that *L2P* depends on are required to be available (which currently are `inspect` and `nan`).

In the Earth Observation domain, different terms are used to describe EO data(sets). In openEO, it is referred to as a "Collection". Thus, a collection is a sequence of granules sharing the same product specification. It typically corresponds to the series of products derived from data acquired by a sensor on board of a satellite and having the same mode of operation. 

In openEO, a back-end offers a set of collections to be processed.  A user can load (a subset of) a collection using the `load_collection` process, which returns a raster data cube. 

The following are the list of data collections available currently in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem backend through openEO.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
import openeo
connection = openeo.connect("openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu")

```
```{python}
#| echo: false
connection.list_collections()
```

## Validity of signed URLs in batch job results

Batch job results are accessible to the user via signed URLs stored in the result assets. Within the platform,
these URLs have a validity (expiry time) of 7 days. Within these 7 days, the results of a batch job can be accessed
by any person with the URL. Each time a user requests the results from the job endpoint (`GET /jobs/{job_id}/results`),
a freshly signed URL (valid for 7 days) is created for the result assets.

## Customizing batch job resources

Jobs running on the cloud get assigned a default amount of CPU and memory resources. This
may not always be enough for your job, for instance when using UDF's. Also for very large jobs, you may want
to tune your resource settings to optimize for cost.

The example below shows how to start a job with all options set to their default values. It is important to highlight
that default settings are subject to change by the backend whenever needed.

```python
job_options = {
    "executor-memory": "2G",
    "executor-memoryOverhead": "1800m",
    "executor-cores": 1,
    "task-cpus": 1,
    "max-executors": 20,
    "driver-memory": "2G",
    "driver-memoryOverhead": "1G",
    "driver-cores": 1,
    "udf-dependency-archives": [],
    "logging-threshold": "info"
}
cube.execute_batch(job_options=job_options)
```

This is a short overview of the various options:

- `executor-memory`: memory assigned to your workers, for the JVM that executes most predefined processes
- `executor-memoryOverhead`: memory assigned on top of the JVM, for instance to run UDF's
- `executor-cores`: number of CPUs per worker (executor). The number of parallel tasks is executor-cores/task-cpus
- `task-cpus`: CPUs assigned to a single task. UDF's using libraries like Tensorflow can benefit from further parallellization on the level of individual tasks.
- `executor-request-cores`: this settings is only relevant for Kubernetes based backends, allows to overcommit CPU
- `max-executors`: the maximum number of workers assigned to your job. Maximum number of parallel tasks is `max-executors*executor-cores/task-cpus`. Increasing this can inflate your costs, while not necessarily improving performance!
- `driver-memory`: memory assigned to the spark 'driver' JVM that controls execution of your batch job
- `driver-memoryOverhead`: memory assigned to the spark 'driver' on top of JVM memory, for Python processes.
- `logging-threshold`: the threshold for logging, set to 'info' by default, can be set to 'debug' to generate much more logging
- `udf-dependency-archives`: an array of urls pointing to zip files with extra dependencies, see below

### Custom UDF dependencies

User defined functions often depend on (specific versions of) libraries or require small auxiliary data files. The UDF specifications do not yet
define a standardized manner to provide this other than having the ability of selecting from a predefined set of 'runtimes' that than again have a predefined configuration.

We solve this via the `udf-dependency-archives` job option, that allows to specify a list of zip files that should be included in the working directory of the UDF.

This enables the following example workflow for Python UDF's:

1. Create a Python 'virtualenv' with your dependencies
2. Based on the 'site-packages' directory of the virtualenv, create a zip file with all dependencies
3. Upload the zip to a url that can be reached by the backend.
4. In job options, add  `"udf-dependency-archives": ['https://yourhost.com/myEnv.zip#tmp/mydir'] ` The `#tmp/mydir` suffix indicates where you want to unzip your files, relative to the working directory.
5. In your UDF, before trying to import libraries, add your directory to the Python path: `sys.path.insert(0, 'tmp/mydir')`
6. Now your libraries should be loaded before anything else!

Known limitations:

- Your dependencies need to be compatible with the Python version of the backend, currently 3.8.
- Your dependencies need to be compatible with the OS of the backend, currently AlmaLinux 8.
- The backend has a limited set of Python dependencies that are preloaded, and cannot be changed, such as numpy.


### Learning more

The topic of resource optimization is a complex one, and here we just give a short summary. The goal of openEO is to hide most of these
details from the user, but we realize that advanced users sometimes want to have a bit more insight, so in the spirit of being open, we give some hints.

To learn more about these options, we point to the [piece of code](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-geopyspark-driver/blob/faf5d5364a82e870e42efd2a8aee9742f305da9f/openeogeotrellis/backend.py#L1213) that handles this.



Most memory related options are translated to Apache Spark configuration settings, which are documented [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.1/configuration.html#application-properties).

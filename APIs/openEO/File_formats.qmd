File formats and their options are often very different between processing software. To improve interoperability, the openEO API supports the following file formats currently for saving your results.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
import openeo
connection = openeo.connect("openeo.dataspace.copernicus.eu")

```
```{python}
#| echo: false
connection.list_file_formats()
```

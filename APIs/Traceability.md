# Traceability Service

Traceability Service provides the user with means to track the lifecycle of a data product. It acts as a
historian of the product’s lifecycle, collecting the traces of all related events.
These traces then can be used to check the integrity of the product, its current whereabouts, its
impact on other products or ultimately its inadequacy for continued use in case of obsolescence.
Digital signatures on the traces provide users with the ability to verify authenticity and integrity of the
traces themselves – this also enables users to detect any alterations of the product during its
lifecycle.

Users may interact with Traceability API either directly using e.g. curl, or through the open source Traceability command line utility.

## Example

Interaction with Traceability Service by using curl command on Linux:
```
curl -X 'GET' 'https://trace.dataspace.copernicus.eu/api/v1/traces/name/S2A_MSIL1C_20230420T100021_N0509_R122_T33UVP_20230420T120027.SAFE.zip' -H 'accept: application/json'
```
Please be aware that curl command might have a different syntax on Windows. Please refer to curl
official documentation if you have any questions ([https://curl.se/docs/manual.html](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html){target="blank"}).

## Direct access

Interaction with Traceability Service directly via the Traceability Service API:

## Digital Certificates

The Traceability service uses X.509 Certificates to sign information sent to the API. This allows verification of the identity of the user who created the trace. 

Use of certificates with the trace-cli tool:

Users may use certificates issued by the trusted public authority or by the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Certificate Authority.

### About Our Certificate Authority (CA)

Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem operates own Certificate Authority (CA). A CA is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates, which are data files used to cryptographically link an entity with a public key. The role of our CA is to guarantee that the individual granted the unique certificate is, in fact, who they claim to be. This is crucial for secure digital identification and trust.

### Why Do You Need Our Root Certificates?

Certificates are used to sign information sent to our Traceability service. By installing our root certificates, your system will trust the information signed with our certificates generated by the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem CA. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the messages you receive.

### How to Install Our Root Certificates? 

The root certificates can be downloaded by using the links below. Once downloaded, you can install them into your operating system certificate store. The process varies depending on your operating system and browser, so please refer to their respective documentation for detailed instructions.

# Accces to EO data via S3

## What is S3 Service?

S3 is an abbreviation for Simple Storage Service. Its main purpose is to be able to store and easily access any amount of data. Such a solution gives access to a highly scalable, reliable, fast data storage infrastructure.

## Registration

To generate the necessary credentials you must have a registered account on dataspace.copernicus.eu. If you don't have an account, you can register [here](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/login-actions/registration?client_id=cdse-public&tab_id=y6n555-H1GU).

## Request for secrets

In order to obtain secrets, create a ticket to CDSE support. Our operators will provide you with the appropriate credentials. You must provide in such request the e-mail address of the registered CDSE user for whom the credentials will be generated.

## Example access using s3cmd

Having the access and secret key together with the endpoint: **s3.dataspace.copernicus.eu**
You can use any tool to handle access via S3. Below is an example of how to access EO Data using the s3cmd.
**This example is require using Linux environment.**
First, we recommend to create a configuration file. You can create it with tools like vi/vim or nano:
```
vi .s3cfg
vim .s3cfg
nano .s3cfg
```
Copy the following content to your configuration file, with your access and secret key:
```
[default]
access_key = <access_key>
host_base = s3.dataspace.copernicus.eu
host_bucket = s3.dataspace.copernicus.eu
human_readable_sizes = False
secret_key = <secret_key>
use_https = true
check_ssl_certificate = true
```
Then you can run any s3cmd command pointing to the previously created configuration file with parameter `-c`:
```
s3cmd -c ~/.s3cfg ls
```
Below is an example of downloading a product from the EO data repository using s3cmd:
```
s3cmd -c ~/.s3cfg get s3://DIAS/Sentinel-1/SAR/SLC/2016/12/28/S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20161228T044442_20161228T044509_014575_017AE8_4C26.SAFE/measurement/s1a-iw2-slc-vv-20161228t044442-20161228t044508-014575-017ae8-005.tiff
```
If the objects in the repository are archives, for example, such as `S1B_IW_SLC__1SDV_20191013T155948_20191013T160015_018459_022C6B_13A2.SAFE` use the `â€“recursive` parameter to download whole product.

Some of the data collections available in the Copernicus Data Space
Ecosystem are indexed (or we could say "imported") in Sentinel Hub,
which means you can use Sentinel Hub APIs to work with these data
collections. Each of the data collections available in Sentinel Hub
has its own subchapter below, which describes how the data is
pre-processed and how you can access it with Sentinel Hub. For a
general description of these data collections and related satellite
missions, please refer to the general [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem
Data chapter](/Data.qmd).

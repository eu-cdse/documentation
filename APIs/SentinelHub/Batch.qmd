Batch Processing API (or shortly \"Batch API\") enables you to request
data for large areas and/or longer time periods for any Sentinel Hub
supported collection, including BYOC (bring your own data).

It is an asynchronous REST service. This means that data will not be
returned immediately in a request response but will be delivered to your
object storage, which needs to be specified in the request (e.g. bucket,
see [bucket settings](#bucket-settings) below). The processing results
will be divided in tiles as described [below](#processing-results).

## Workflow

The batch processing API comes with the set of REST APIs which support
the execution of various workflows. The diagram below shows all possible
statuses of a batch processing request (`CREATED`, `ANALYSING`,
`ANALYSIS_DONE`, `PROCESSING`, `DONE`, `FAILED`, `CANCELED`, `PARTIAL`)
and user\'s actions (`ANALYSE`, `START`, `RESTART`, `CANCEL`) which
trigger transitions among them.

![](Batch/img/sh_batch_flowchart.png)

The workflow starts when a user posts a new batch processing request. In
this step the system:

-   creates new batch processing request with status `CREATED`,
-   validates the user\'s inputs, and
-   returns an estimated number of output tiles that will be processed.

User can then decide to either request an additional analysis of the
request, start the processing or cancel the request. When additional
analysis is requested:

-   the status of the request changes to `ANALYSING`,
-   the evalscript is validated,
-   a list of required tiles is created, and
-   the request\'s cost is estimated, i.e. the estimated number of
    processing units (PU) needed for the requested processing. Note that
    in case of `ORBIT` or `TILE` mosaicking the cost estimate can be
    significantly inaccurate, as described [below](#cost-estimate).
-   After the analysis is finished the status of the request changes to
    `ANALYSIS_DONE`.

In the evalscript validation for ORBIT and TILE mosaicking, we select a
few orbits or tiles that match your request, and test if your evalscript
can process them. We also test, if your evalscript can process the case,
when no orbit or tile is passed. So make sure your evalscript handles
this.

If the user chooses to directly start processing, the system still
executes the analysis but when the analysis is done it automatically
starts with processing. This is not explicitly shown in the diagram in
order to keep it simple.

The user can now request a list of tiles for their request, start the
processing, or cancel the request. When the user starts the processing:

-   the estimated number of PU is reserved,
-   the status of the request changes to `PROCESSING` (this may take a
    while),
-   the processing starts.

When the processing finishes, the status of the request changes to:

-   `FAILED` when all tiles failed processing,
-   `PARTIAL` when some tiles were processed and some failed,
-   `DONE` when all tiles were processed.

Although the process has built-in fault tolerance, occasionally, tile
processing may fail. In this case, the batch request ends up in status
`PARTIAL` and user can request restart its processing as shown in [this
example](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch/Examples.qmd#restart-a-partially-processed-batch-processing-request-restart).
This will restart processing of all `FAILED` tiles.

#### Canceling the request

User may cancel the request at any time. However:

-   if the status is `ANALYSING`, the analysis will complete,
-   if the status is `PROCESSING`, all tiles that have been processed or
    are being processed at that moment are charged for. The remaining
    PUs are returned to the user.

#### Automatic deletion of stale data

Stale requests will be deleted after some time. Specifically, the
following requests will be deleted:

-   failed requests (request status `FAILED`),
-   requests that were created but never started (request statuses
    `CREATED`, `ANALYSIS_DONE`),
-   successful requests (request statuses `DONE` and `PARTIAL`) for
    which it was not requested to add the results to your collections.
    Note that only such requests themselves will be deleted, while the
    requests\' result (created imagery) will remain under your control
    in your bucket.

#### Cost estimate

The cost estimate, provided in the analysis stage, is based on the rules
for calculating [processing
units](/APIs/SentinelHub/Overview/ProcessingUnit.qmd). It takes the
number of output pixels, the number of input bands, and the output
format into account. However, for mosaicking `ORBIT` or `TILE` the
number of data samples (i.e. the no. of observations available in the
requested time range) can not be calculated accurately during the
analysis. Our cost estimate is thus based on the assumption that one
data sample is available every three days within the requested time
range. For example, we assume 10 available data samples between 1.1.2021
and 31.1.2021. If you request batch processing of more/fewer data
samples, the actual cost will be proportionally higher/lower.

The actual costs can be significantly different from the estimate if:

-   the number of data samples is reduced in your evalscript by
    [`preProcessScenes`](/APIs/SentinelHub/Evalscript/V3.qmd#preprocessscenes-function-optional)
    function or by filters such as `maxCloudCoverage`. The actual cost
    will be lower than the estimate.
-   your AOI (area of interest) includes large areas with no data, e.g.
    when requesting Sentinel-2 data over oceans. The actual cost will be
    lower than the estimate.
-   you request processing of data collections with revisit period
    shorter/longer than three days (e.g. your BYOC collection). The
    actual cost will be proportionally higher/lower than the estimate.
    Revisit period depends also on selected AOI, e.g. the actual costs
    of processing Sentinel-2 data close to the equator/at high latitudes
    will be lower/higher than the estimate.

If you know how many data samples per pixel will be processed, you can
adjust the estimate yourself. For example, if you request processing for
data that is available daily, the cost will be 3 times higher than our
estimate.

Note that the cost estimate does **not** take the multiplication factor
of 1/3 for batch processing into account. The actual costs will be 3
times lower than the estimate.

#### Tile status

Users can follow the progress of tile processing by checking for their
current status. This can be done directly in Dashboard, or via [the
API](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#tag/batch_tile). The statuses
are as follows:

1.  In the analysis phase, tiles are created with status PENDING.
2.  When tiles move into scheduling queue, their status changes to
    SCHEDULED.
3.  When a tile is pulled from the queue and processing starts, it
    becomes PROCESSING.
4.  When tile processing succeeds/fails, it\'s DONE/FAILED.
5.  If a tile gets stuck, it goes back into PENDING up to twice. If it
    gets stuck the third time, it becomes a FAILED tile.
6.  When a batch request with status PARTIAL is restarted, all its
    FAILed tiles go back into PENDING.

## Tiling grids

For more effective processing we divide the area of interest into tiles
and process each tile separately. While `process` API uses grids which
come together with each datasource for processing of the data, the
`batch` API uses one of the predefined tiling grids. The predefined
tiling grids 0-2 are based on the [Sentinel-2
tiling](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products){target="_blank"}
in WGS84/UTM projection with some adjustments:

-   The width and height of tiles in the original Sentinel 2 grid is 100
    km while the width and height of tiles in our grids are given in the
    table below.
-   All redundant tiles (i.e. fully overlapped tiles) are removed.

All available tiling grids can be requested with (*NOTE: To run this
example you need to first create an OAuth client as is explained
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/Overview/Authentication.qmd#python)*):

``` python
url = "https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/api/v1/batch/tilinggrids/"

response = oauth.request("GET", url)

response.json()
```

This will return the list of available grids and information about tile
size and available resolutions for each grid. Currently, available grids
are:

\*\* The geometries of the tiles are reprojected to WGS84 for download.
Because of this and other reasons the geometries of the output rasters
may differ from the tile geometries provided here.

To use `20km` grid with 60 m resolution, for example, specify `id` and
`resolution` parameters of the `tilingGrid` object when creating a new
batch request (see an example of [full
request](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch/Examples.qmd#create-a-batch-processing-request))
as:

``` JSON
{
  ...
  "tilingGrid": {
    "id": 0,
    "resolution": 60.0
  },
  ...
}
```

Contact us if you would like to use any other grid for processing.

## Batch collection

Batch processing results can also be uploaded into a BYOC-like
collection, which makes it possible to:

-   Access data with Processing API, by using the collection ID
-   Create a configuration with custom layers
-   Make OGC requests to a configuration
-   View data in EO Browser

The users can either upload data to an existing batch collection by
specyfing the `collectionId`, or create a new one by using the
`createCollection` parameter. Read about both options in [BATCH API
reference](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#operation/createNewBatchProcessingRequest).

When creating a new batch collection, one has to be careful to:

-   Make sure that `"cogOutput"=true`
-   Make sure the evalscript returns only single-band outputs
-   Keep `sampleType` in mind, as the values the evalscript returns when
    creating a collection will be the values available when making a
    request to access it

Regardless of whether the user specifies an existing collection or
requests a new one, processed data will still upload to the users
bucket, where they will be available for download and analysis.

## Processing results

The outputs of a batch processing will be stored to your object storage
in either GeoTIFF (and JSON for metadata) or in Zarr format.

### GeoTIFF output format

GeoTIFF format will be used if your request contains the `output` field.
An example of a batch request with GeoTIFF output is available
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch/Examples.qmd#option-1-geotiff-format-output).

By default, the results will be organized in sub-folders where one
sub-folder will be created for each tile. Each sub-folder might contain
one or more images depending on how many outputs were defined in the
[evalscript](/APIs/SentinelHub/Evalscript/V3.qmd#setup-function) of the
request.

You can also customize the sub-folder structure and file naming as
described in the `defaultTilePath` parameter under `output` in [BATCH
API
reference](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#operation/createNewBatchProcessingRequest)
.

You can choose to return your GeoTIFF files as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF
(COG), by setting the `cogOutput` parameter under `output` in your
request as `true`. Several advanced COG options can be selected as
well - read about the parameter in [BATCH API
reference](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#operation/createNewBatchProcessingRequest).

The results of batch processing will be in the projection of the
selected [tiling grid](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch.qmd#tiling-grids). For
UTM-based grids, each part of the AOI (area of interest) is delivered in
the UTM zone with which it intersects. In other words, in case your AOI
intersects with more UTM zones, the results will be delivered as tiles
in different UTM zones (and thus different CRSs).

### Zarr output format

Zarr format will be used if your request contains the `zarrOutput`
field. An example of a batch request with Zarr output is available
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch/Examples.qmd#option-2-zarr-format-output).
Your request **must** only have one band per output and the
`application/json` format in responses is **not** supported.

The outputs of batch processing will be stored as a single Zarr group
containing one data array for each evalscript output and multiple
coordinate arrays. By default, the Zarr will be stored in the folder you
pass to the batch processing api in the `path` parameter under
`zarrOutput` (see [BATCH API
reference](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#tag/batch_process/operation/createNewBatchProcessingRequest)).
The folder **must not** contain any existing Zarr files. We recommend
using a placeholder `<requestId>` as explained in the API reference to
keep the results of your processing better organized.

The results of batch processing will be in the projection of the
selected [tiling grid](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch.qmd#tiling-grids). The
tiling grids where output CRS is UTM zone are not supported for Zarr
format output.

## Bucket settings

The results will be delivered in your own bucket hosted at Copernicus
Data Space Ecosystem.

If you do not yet have a bucket at Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem,
please follow [these
steps](https://creodias.docs.cloudferro.com/en/latest/s3/Create-S3-bucket-and-use-it-in-Sentinel-Hub-requests.html){target="_blank"}
to get one.

You will have to configure your bucket to allow full access to Sentinel
Hub. To do this, [update your bucket
policy](https://creodias.docs.cloudferro.com/en/latest/s3/Bucket-sharing-using-s3-bucket-policy-on-Creodias.html#setting-a-policy-on-the-bucket){target="_blank"}
to include the following statement (don't forget to replace
`<bucket_name>` with your actual bucket name):

``` default
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Sentinel Hub permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ddf4c98b5e6647f0a246f0624c8341d9:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

A python script to set a bucket policy can be downloaded
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch/resources/python/cdse_set_bucket_policy.py).

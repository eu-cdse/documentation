title: Authentication
---

The Sentinel Hub API uses OAuth2 Authentication and requires that you
have an access token. In essence, this is a piece of information you add
to your requests so the server knows it\'s you. These tokens do not last
forever for a multitude of reasons, but you can get new ones and when
they expire from the Sentinel-Hub OAuth2 server at the token endpoint
listed below. But first, if you do not have one already, you need to
register an OAuth Client in your [account
settings](https://shapps.dataspace.copernicus.eu/dashboard/#/account/settings){target="_blank"}.
This is so the server can expect you to make such token requests.

#### How to use tokens

Once you have a token, do use it for authenticating all your requests
within its validity period. While tokens do not last forever, they do
last a reasonable amount of time, and sufficiently long that they can be
reused. The information of how long each token lasts is embedded in the
token itself in the `exp` claim, and can be read from there.

Do not fetch a new token for each API request you make. Token requests
are rate limited, so if you are getting an HTTP 429 error, that means
you are requesting too many tokens.

Tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT), more information about them
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token){target="_blank"} or
[here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519){target="_blank"}.

### Registering OAuth client

To register an OAuth client, open the "User Settings" tab in the
Dashboard app and locate the "OAuth clients" section. Click on the
`Create` button (1). Provide a name for your OAuth client (2). You can
select the Expiry date for your client (3) or select "Never expire" if
you want your OAuth client to be indefinite (4). For OAuth clients
without expiration you will need to confirm your understanding of risks
(5). If your OAuth client will be used by a single-page application
(SPA), select the corresponding option (6). If the SPA option is
selected, you\'ll be prompted to choose between \"Allow all domains\"
(7) or specify the web origins (8) from which the OAuth Client will be
used. Confirmation is required if you selected to use the OAuth client
in a frontend application, acknowledging the risks of exposure (9).

Once all mandatory fields are filled, proceed by clicking the `Create`
button (10).

Your client ID and client secret will be displayed. You may now copy
both client ID and the client secret (11). Ensure to copy the secret
value and paste it securely as it won't be retrievable once the pop-up
closes! After copying, click `Close`(12). With the client ID and client
secret in hand, you are now prepared to request tokens.

Upon completion, you'll find your newly created OAuth client with its
corresponding ID and name (13) listed under the "OAuth clients" section.

#### Inactive clients

Once an OAuth client has expired, it is moved to a list of inactive
clients. Similarly, deleted clients will also appear in this list as
inactive clients.

### OAuth2 Endpoints

Token Endpoint - for requesting tokens

``` default
https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token
```

### Token Request Examples

#### cURL

The following cURL request will return an access token, just make sure
to replace `<your client id>` with your client ID and
`<your client secret>` with your client secret:

``` bash
curl --request POST --url https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<your client id>' --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<your client secret>'
```

#### Postman

In the Postman request `Authorization` tab set the `Type` to `OAuth 2.0`
and `Add auth data to` to `Request Headers`. Set the `Grant Type` to
`Client Credentials`, the access token URL to the token endpoint, then
set the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to the values of your OAuth
Client. `Scope` can be blank. Set `Client Authentication` to
`Send client credentials in body`. Click `Get New Access Token` button.
You should get a new one immediately. To use this token to authorize
your request, click `Use Token`. For more information see the Postman
[authorization
documentation](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization/#oauth-20){target="_blank"}

#### Python

In python the
[requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib){target="_blank"}
library can handle the retrieval of access tokens using your OAuth
Client configuration.

``` python
from oauthlib.oauth2 import BackendApplicationClient
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session

# Your client credentials
client_id = '<client_id>'
client_secret = '<secret>'

# Create a session
client = BackendApplicationClient(client_id=client_id)
oauth = OAuth2Session(client=client)

# Get token for the session
token = oauth.fetch_token(token_url='https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token',
                          client_secret=client_secret, include_client_id=True)

# All requests using this session will have an access token automatically added
resp = oauth.get("https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/configuration/v1/wms/instances")
print(resp.content)
```

`requests-oauthlib` doesn\'t check for status before checking if the
response is ok. In case there\'s a server error, the user can receive an
incorrect error, which falsely makes it seem as if the issue is on
client side. Library\'s compliance hooks will prevent the invalid status
response from being ignored, returning the correct error. To use them,
add the following code:

``` python
def sentinelhub_compliance_hook(response):
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response

oauth.register_compliance_hook("access_token_response", sentinelhub_compliance_hook)
```

#### Javascript

Example using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios){target="_blank"}.

``` javascript
import axios from "axios"
import qs from "qs"

const client_id = "<client_id>"
const client_secret = "<secret>"

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu"
})

const config = {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8'
  }
}

const body = qs.stringify({
  client_id,
  client_secret,
  grant_type: "client_credentials"
})


// All requests using this instance will have an access token automatically added
instance.post("https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token", body, config).then(resp => {
  Object.assign(instance.defaults, {headers: {authorization: `Bearer ${resp.data.access_token}`}})
})
```

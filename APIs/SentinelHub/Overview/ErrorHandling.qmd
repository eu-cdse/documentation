title: Error handling
---

Whenever an error occurs, whether it be the fault of the user or an
internal system, an error object will be returned. HTTP response codes
of 4xx suggest a bad request. If you receive a 4xx response, we
recommend reviewing the API docs for more context to help you
troubleshoot. 5xx errors suggest a problem on Sentinel Hub\'s end, so if
you receive a 5xx error, please contact support.

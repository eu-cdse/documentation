title: OGC service
---

Our OGC services offer the access to the Sentinel Hub functionalists via
interfaces, which conform to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
standards: [WMS](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wms/){target="_blank"},
[WCS](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wcs/){target="_blank"},
[WFS](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wfs/){target="_blank"}, and
[WMTS](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wmts/){target="_blank"}.

Using the OGC services you can avoid the complexities of preprocessing
of satellite data. No need to download the data, no dealing with the JP2
format, no re-projecting, or mosaicking. No need for large storage
volumes and lots of processing power. Simply add a new data collection
in your GIS application (ArcGIS, QGIS, OpenLayers, Google Earth or any
other app supporting standard services) and start using the data right
away! Find more information on:

### Configuration Instance and Authentication

To use any of our OGC services you will need a \"configuration
instance\" (or shortly \"instance\"). A configuration instance defines
which layers are part of your OGC service, how the data shall be
processed and visualized for each of these layers, and its id is used to
authenticate your OGC requests. You can create a configuration instance
using our [Configuration
API](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#tag/configuration_instance/operation/createWmsInstance)
or in the Sentinel Hub
[Dashboard](https://shapps.dataspace.copernicus.eu/dashboard/#/){target="_blank"}
in the \"Configuration Utility\" tab. \"Simple WMS Instance\" is a
pre-created configuration instance, which comes with your Sentinel Hub
account and you can use its id (\"9d559\...\" in the example below but
yours will have a different id) to run the [OGC
examples](/APIs/SentinelHub/OGC/Examples.qmd).

To get you started, we have prepared a [webinar on OGC API with QGIS
integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBIlTOl2po4){target="_blank"},
explaining the structure of OGC requests, how to run them in web
browser, Postman and Python and integrate them into your own GIS.

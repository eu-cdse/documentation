# STAC product catalog


[STAC API](https://stacspec.org){target="blank"} endpoint: `https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac/`

STAC (Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog) is a relatively new web service specification for catalogs that is increasingly used and supported.

The version exposed in the Copernicus Dataspace is still subject to change as the quality of STAC metadata is still improving. Nevertheless,
it already supports basic product search.

We are aware of issues with using the current version with generic STAC libraries. The data model in the Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem is still evolving to comply fully with all standardized properties. Our dedicated teams are actively working on its development to ensure a seamless experience for all our customers. However, as the version exposed in the Copernicus Dataspace is still subject to change as the quality of STAC metadata is still improving, we kindly ask for your patience and understanding.

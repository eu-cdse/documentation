Concentrations of short-lived pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, are indicators of changes in economic slowdowns and are comparable to changes in emissions. Using a 14 day average eliminates some effects which are caused by short term weather changes and cloud cover. The average gives an overview over the whole time period and therefore reflects trends better than shorter time periods.\n\nOffered Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchive Status\n\n\nAccess Type\n\n\nSpatial Extent\n\n\nTemporal Extent\n\n\nAvailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon Time Critical (NTC)\n\n\nPacked or Unpacked\n\n\nImmediately available data (IAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nApr 2018 - Present\n\n\nJan 2023\n\n\n\n\nNear Real Time (NRT)\n\n\nPacked or Unpacked\n\n\nImmediately available data (IAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nLast one month\n\n\nJan 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther details about the data collection\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Extent\n\n[-180, -90, 180, 90]\n\n\n\nTemporal Interval\n\n[‘Apr 2018 - Present’]"

    "text": "The Sentinel-1 radar imaging mission is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continous all-weather, day and night imagery for Land and Maritime Monitoring. C-band synthentic aperture radar imaging has the advantage of operating at wavelenghts that are not obstructed by clouds or lack of illumination and therefore can acquire data during day or night under all weather conditions.\nThe end of mission of the Sentinel-1B satellite has been declared in July 2022 On 23 December 2021, Copernicus Sentinel-1B experienced an anomaly related to the instrument electronics power supply provided by the satellite platform, leaving it unable to deliver radar data. Despite all investigations and recovery attempts, ESA and the European Commission had to announce that it is the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B. Copernicus Sentinel-1A remains fully operational. More information about the end of the mission for the Sentinel-1B satellite can be found on the webpage Mission ends for Copernicus Sentinel-1B satellite. In response to the loss of Sentinel-1B, the mission observation scenario of Sentinel-1A was adjusted, affecting the nominal global coverage frequency. An up-to-date overview of the observation scenario in place can be consulted on the webpage Sentinel-1 Observation Scenario. Some regions are currently not observed by Sentinel-1. Nevertheless, the regions that are still observed, now have a repeat cycle of 12 under a one-satellite constellation scenario, which affects possible interferometric analyses.\nSentinel data products are made available systematically and free of charge to all data users including the general public, scientific and commercial users. These data products are available in single polarisation for Wave mode and dual polarisation or single polarisation for SM, IW and EW modes.\nSentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe Sentinel 1 GRD products in this Collection consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. The ellipsoid projection of the GRD products is corrected using the terrain height specified in the product general annotation. The terrain height used varies in azimuth but is constant in range (but can be different for each IW/EW sub-swath). Ground range coordinates are the slant range coordinates projected onto the ellipsoid of the Earth. Pixel values represent detected amplitude. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has approximately square resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at a cost of reduced spatial resolution.\n\nOffered Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchive Status\n\n\nAccess Type\n\n\nSpatial Extent\n\n\nTemporal Extent\n\n\nAvailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(*) Packed or Unpacked\n\n\nImmediately available data (IAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nOct 2014 - Present\n\n\nJan 2023\n\n\n\n\nPacked or Unpacked, SAFE with Cloud optimized GeoTIFF\n\n\nImmediately available data (IAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nOct 2014 - Present\n\n\nJul 2023\n\n\n\n\nPacked, original SAFE\n\n\nImmediately available data (IAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nLast one year\n\n\nJul 2023\n\n\n\n\nPacked, original SAFE\n\n\nDeferred available data (DAD)\n\n\nWorld\n\n\nOct 2014 - Present (1 year)\n\n\nJul 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n(*) temporary offer available until the target service offer becomes available in July 2023.\n\nFurther details about the data collection\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Extent\n\n[-180, -90, 180, 90]\n\n\n\nTemporal Interval\n\n[‘Oct 2014 - Present’]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Links\n\n\nSTAC: https://stac-extensions.github.io/datacube/v1.0.0/schema.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe Sentinel 1 SLC{target= ’_blank’} products are images in the slant range by azimuth imaging plane, in the image plane of satellite data acquisition.

    "text": "What is the phase-out timing for the current Copernicus Data Hub distribution services?\n\n\nThe legacy Copernicus Data Hub distribution service will remain in operations until end of June 2023 to allow a smooth migration to the new Copernicus Data Access service by all user communities. The Copernicus Data Hub distribution service will continue offering access to Sentinel data with a gradual ramp-down of the operations capacity and data offering until end of September 2023.\n\n\n\n\nComparing with existing legacy Copernicus Data Hub, what will be the other free services other than stac/cog?\n\n\nCompared to existing Copernicus Data Hub, there will indeed be additional APIs - OGC interfaces (WMS, WMTS, WCS), OpenEO, Sentinel Hub API, S3, and others. Please refer to the Roadmap for more info on the timing of these interfaces.\n\n\n\n\nIs there an end user document available online that describes the specific data products available and specific services?\n\n\nThe user level details for every service and dataset will be provided in this documentation. With every service and dataset embedded into the ecosystem, this documentation will be updated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nHow long is the project timescale in total ?\n\n\nThe time scale of the project is 6 years (i.e., to the end of 2028) with an optional extension up to 10 years (i.e., 2032).\n\n\n\n\nCan anyone outside from Europe have free access to any data?\n\n\nYes, data and services will be available to users worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat data will be offered online and what is the timeline for the following months?\n\n\nFor the details on the data offer and timing, we would like to refer to the Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nIs there a page that indicates anomalies with the datasets?\n\n\nThe Copernicus Operations Dashboard provides details of events over the past three months that have impact on the completeness of the data production, such as planned calibration activities, manoeuvrers, or anomalies. The information of which data is affected is included.\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to cloud native formats/interfaces, will the data also be available in the original data formats (e.g. for data downloading)?\n\n\nYes, data will also be available in original data formats (i.e. .SAFE).\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment some of the data are delivered in Jpeg2000, is there any plan to abandon that format for the COG?\n\n\nThere is currently no plan to convert Sentinel-2 in COGs. However, there is a parallel activity happening within ESA to define format evolution for all Sentinels which will be followed, once decisions are taken. But this is not something that is happening on the short term.\n\n\n\n\nWill data, such as Sentinel-2, be processed to a consistent version?\n\n\nThe Sentinel-2 data will be available at the latest processing baseline. And with the reprocessing of Sentinel-2 happening in parallel (out of scope of this project), these will become available on this service as well.\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to download a subset of data corresponding to an AOI, instead of the whole image?\n\n\nYes, you will be able to download a subset of data, either using S3 interface, or dedicated APIs, i.e. Sentinel Hub, OpenEO when they become available. See Roadmap section of the documentation.\n\n\n\n\nAre the data offered via Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (also Level 1)?\n\n\nSentinel-1 GRD data will be available in COG format. Sentinel-2 will stay in JP2 for the moment, as it is a similarly performant cloud optimised format.\n\n\n\n\nWhen “on-line data” is mentioned, does that mean the data are not on tape?\n\n\nThe “on-line data” or IAD we are referring to, are indeed not on the tapes. Tapes will still be there for redundancy reasons.\n\n\n\n\nFor the S3 access in the free tier, will there be no cost for network traffic?\n\n\nS3 access will be part of free services as well, within the same constraints as the rest of the services.\n\n\n\n\nCan we download the data acquired by all Sentinel missions (1, 2, 3, 5P, 6) and the other satellites (e.g. Meteosat) via the new interface? Some missions are not managed by ESA, but by EUMETSAT for example.\n\n\nInitialy Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and Sentinel 5P data up to L2 products will be available. Sentinel 6 data and data from Meteosat are currently not in the roadmap of the project. However access to Copernicus Contributing Missions CORE Datasets, Digital Elevation Models, data from Copernicus Services and additional data sets such as Landsat and ENVISAT and Belgian Collaborative Ground Segment hosted data are planned in the future. The Data Roadmap shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data will become available.\n\n\n\n\nWill it still be the case that data is labelled as “on/offline” on the current legacy portal?\n\n\nThe vast majority of the data will be on-line : all Sentinel-2 L1C/L2A, Sentinel-1 SLC/GRD and just about all other relevant data collections.\n\n\n\n\nWill the new interface offer EO ready-to-use products or just L0 and L1 data?\n\n\nUp to L2 products will be available. The Roadmap shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we develop an EO ready-to-use product, could we integrate it into the interface and ask the payment from clients?\n\n\nYes, commercial services can be built on top, similar to Copernicus open license.\n\n\n\n\nCan the user come with wish-list to services data products?\n\n\nUser can come with suggestions to improve or expand the service portfolio. A user forum will be set up and released by July to accommodate this.\n\n\n\n\nAre you going to develop new services on DAS after July 2023?\n\n\nYes, a marketplace will be available where new Third party services will be able to onboard from July onwards to expand the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any limitation on the max number of downloads at one time?\n\n\nYes, there will be quotas and constraints for different services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n\n\n\n\nIf I’m having troubles with registering, what can I do?\n\n\nPlease e-mail the help-login@dataspace.copernicus.eu address for direct support on this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP/gpt processing codes can be used in these on-line and cloud processing services?\n\n\nSNAP is integrated in cloud environment, and there will even be some dedicated on-demand services based on SNAP (i.e. S1 processing to coherence, etc).\n\n\n\n\nIs a STAC catalog planned ? Will the data be accessible on cloud object storage (S3)?\n\n\nSTAC Catalog API is indeed planned. Note that the phase-in will take from end of January to July 2023. So services will be added during this timeline, not everything will be available at the beginning. All the data will be available over S3 as well.\n\n\n\n\nWill LTA process be discontinued when all archived data become online?\n\n\nThere will still be services available for so called “deferred data access” : data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all most relevant collections will be available on-line. The Roadmap shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n\n\n\n\nWill the platform use STAC standards?\n\n\nYes, there will be STAC compliant Catalog API, as well as STAC items for inpidual products.\n\n\n\n\nAny plan to offer the Pangeo platform for a “pythonist”?\n\n\nThis is currently not in the offer or roadmap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any difference between EU users and non-EU users?\n\n\nThere is no difference between EU users and non-EU users. That said, there will be a continuity of the accounts with higher throughput, managed by ESA (i.e. Copernicus Services, International Hub, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nWhich distribution channels will be available for high-throughput data access? I assume the public side (dataspase.copernicus.eu) has a bandwidth limitation. Or does the public side have user tiers, or is high-throughput data transfer (such as https://creodias.eu/remote-transfer-for-eodata ) only a paid service?\n\n\nAll distribution options (i.e. OData, S3, Sentinel Hub,..) will be constrained with user quotas, which includes both bandwidth limitation, as well as monthly limits.\n\n\n\n\nCan you give indictions about the cost of the “extra” services?\n\n\nPricing will be published soon.\n\n\n\n\n This December advertisement of DAS says that “For those interested in processing, there will be scalable cloud resources available, optimized for EO tasks”. Does this refer to the current CreoDIAS resources, or something completely new that hasn’t been addressed yet? \n\n\nScalable cloud resources will be part of the commercial offering and can be obtained at CREODIAS in first instance. ICT-wise, there will be two options, including Open Telekom Cloud.\n\n\n\n\nAre there tutorials (online & physical meetings) to use the new interface?\n\n\nTutorials will be added to the documentation in due time explaining the usage of the different interfaces. We will also be present on different conferences explaining the service & ecosystem."

    "text": "Will there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we develop an EO ready-to-use product, could we integrate it into the interface and ask the payment from clients?\n\n\nYes, commercial services can be built on top, similar to Copernicus open license.\n\n\n\n\nCan the user come with wish-list to services data products?\n\n\nUser can come with suggestions to improve or expand the service portfolio. A user forum will be set up and released by July to accommodate this.\n\n\n\n\nAre you going to develop new services on DAS after July 2023?\n\n\nYes, a marketplace will be available where new Third party services will be able to onboard from July onwards to expand the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any limitation on the max number of downloads at one time?\n\n\nYes, there will be quotas and constraints for different services."

    "text": "SNAP/gpt processing codes can be used in these on-line and cloud processing services?\n\n\nSNAP is integrated in cloud environment, and there will even be some dedicated on-demand services based on SNAP (i.e. S1 processing to coherence, etc).\n\n\n\n\nIs a STAC catalog planned ? Will the data be accessible on cloud object storage (S3)?\n\n\nSTAC Catalog API is indeed planned. Note that the phase-in will take from end of January to July 2023. So services will be added during this timeline, not everything will be available at the beginning. All the data will be available over S3 as well.\n\n\n\n\nWill LTA process be discontinued when all archived data become online?\n\n\nThere will still be services available for so called “deferred data access” : data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all most relevant collections will be available on-line. The Roadmap shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n\n\n\n\nWill the platform use STAC standards?\n\n\nYes, there will be STAC compliant Catalog API, as well as STAC items for inpidual products.\n\n\n\n\nAny plan to offer the Pangeo platform for a “pythonist”?\n\n\nThis is currently not in the offer or roadmap."

    "text": "Is there any difference between EU users and non-EU users?\n\n\nThere is no difference between EU users and non-EU users. That said, there will be a continuity of the accounts with higher throughput, managed by ESA (i.e. Copernicus Services, International Hub, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nWhich distribution channels will be available for high-throughput data access? I assume the public side (dataspase.copernicus.eu) has a bandwidth limitation. Or does the public side have user tiers, or is high-throughput data transfer (such as https://creodias.eu/remote-transfer-for-eodata ) only a paid service?\n\n\nAll distribution options (i.e. OData, S3, Sentinel Hub,..) will be constrained with user quotas, which includes both bandwidth limitation, as well as monthly limits.\n\n\n\n\nCan you give indictions about the cost of the “extra” services?\n\n\nPricing will be published soon.\n\n\n\n\n This December advertisement of DAS says that “For those interested in processing, there will be scalable cloud resources available, optimized for EO tasks”. Does this refer to the current CreoDIAS resources, or something completely new that hasn’t been addressed yet? \n\n\nScalable cloud resources will be part of the commercial offering and can be obtained at CREODIAS in first instance. ICT-wise, there will be two options, including Open Telekom Cloud.\n\n\n\n\nAre there tutorials (online & physical meetings) to use the new interface?\n\n\nTutorials will be added to the documentation in due time explaining the usage of the different interfaces. We will also be present on different conferences explaining the service & ecosystem."

The requests over the limit will be rejected with the code 400. Therefore, we encourage you to limit your inquiries by geographic or temporal area.\nAll queries may be executed as simple HTTP-Get calls by typing the query in the web browser address line, by using any HTTP client, e.g. curl or wget, or from inside of the users’ program. The database is accessible free and anonymously (open for anonymous access for everyone, no authorization is used). It may be accessed both from the internal network (virtual machines in Creodias) and from outside, e.g. your home computer. Note that the actual EO data are restricted to authorized users; only the Data Catalogue is open.\n\nGeneral Rules\nThe queries produce results in JSON format.

A query may search for data in all collections or in one particular collection only. If only one satellite is in the field of interest, the second approach is faster and more efficient than filtering the general query. For example, to find the ten most recent Sentinel-2 products with cloud cover below 10%, the query should look like:\n\nCLI\n\n\n$ wget -O - \"http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2022-06-22T23:59:59Z&maxRecords=10\"\n\n\n\nwhile if the collection field is missing in the URL, the products from all the satellites are returned:\n\nCLI\n\n\n$ wget -O - \"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2022-06-22T23:59:59Z&maxRecords=10\"\n\n\n\nAs for today the following collections are defined and may be used:\n\nSentinel1 or SENTINEL-1\nSentinel2 or SENTINEL-2\nSentinel3 or SENTINEL-3\nSentinel5P or SENTINEL-5P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote, that collection names vary a bit from satellite names, as they are used in EO Data repository. For example, the collection is named Sentinel2, while in the repository its data are located within /eodata/Sentinel-2/…. branch of the repository tree.\n\n\n\n\nOutput sorting and limiting\nBy default, maximum of 20 products are returned. You may change the limit (beware of long execution time for queries about thousands of products) using the phrase:\n\nmaxRecords=nnn\n\nIf the query is very general and the number of matching products is large, the next pages of products can be retrieved using:\n\npage=nnn\n\nIt is also possible to alter the sequence in which the products are displayed by using a phrase similar to:\n\nsortParam=startDate\n\nThis will sort the output by observation date. The following orderings can be implemented:\n\nstartDate - the date when the observation was made (start)\ncompletionDate - the date when the observation was made (end)\npublished - the date when the product got published in our repository\n\nEeach of these ordering can be be accompanied by:\n\nsortOrder=ascending or sortOrder=descending\n\nFor example the query\n\nHTTP RequestPython\n\n\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2021-07-31T23:59:59Z&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20\n\n\n\n\nCode\njson = requests.get(\"http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2021-07-31T23:59:59Z&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20\").json()\npd.DataFrame.from_dict(json['features']).head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nid\ngeometry\nproperties\n\n\n\n\n0\nFeature\n010f2ad1-0199-4bd8-850a-215b5c63b0b9\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[158.5965...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n1\nFeature\n06ccfceb-938e-4bda-beff-3c2acae864b2\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[158.5288...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n2\nFeature\n229dd65c-399d-48bc-a116-14bb0e001742\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[157.1876...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above request will return 20 products from July 2021, whereas the next query will return the next 20:\n\nHTTP RequestPython\n\n\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2021-07-31T23:59:59Z&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20&page=2\n\n\n\n\nCode\njson = requests.get(\"http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01T00:00:00Z&completionDate=2021-07-31T23:59:59Z&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20&page=2\").json()\npd.DataFrame.from_dict(json['features']).head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nid\ngeometry\nproperties\n\n\n\n\n0\nFeature\ncdaed6e4-99c3-44db-89e6-efbd21276bef\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[156.7053...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n1\nFeature\nd2a89e60-4b83-4cb6-a3d7-d926e2b804df\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[156.0567...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n2\nFeature\nd4e341a1-719f-4297-a6f2-1c5d10098c12\n{'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[[158.1844...\n{'collection': 'SENTINEL-2', 'status': 'ONLINE...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal queries\nThe formal query is invoked as a sequence of sub phrases, separated by &.

The most commonly used such feature is cloudiness, or cloudCover, which is defined for most of the products coming from optical sensors. For example:\n\ncloudCover=[0,10]\n\nThis parameter selects only those scenes, which are covered by clouds by no more than 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nTo be meaningful, the cloudiness must be provided with each product, while in many products is missing. If the cloudiness is unknown for the scene, it is marked by a value of 0 or -1. cloudCover=0 is therefore ambiguous: it may either mean totally cloudless sky or the cloudy scene for which cloud cover had not been estimated during original data processing.\n\n\n\n\nSatellite features\n\ninstrument - meaningful only for satellites equipped with multiple instruments. The possible values are satellite specific.\nproductType - the actual types possible are specific for every satellite.\nsensorMode - also satellite and sensor specific. E.g. (for Sentinel-1): sensorMode=EW\norbitDirection - ASCENDING or DESCENDING. For most heliosynchronous satellites descending orbits means the day scenes, while ascending means night ones. For many optical satellites (e.g. Sentinel-2) only day scenes are published.\nresolution - expected spatial resolution of the product defined in meters.\nstatus:\n\n\n\nONLINE\nOFFLINE\n\n\nSome additional parameters are strictly satellite-specific, e.g. polarisation, which is defined only for Sentinel-1.\nFor every satellite (collection) its set of query-able parameters may be obtained by a query like:\n\nHTTP RequestPython\n\n\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel1/describe.xml\n\n\n\n\nCode\nurl = 'https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel1/describe.xml'\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nroot = ET.fromstring(response.content)\n\nfor child in root:\n    if child.tag.endswith('ShortName') or child.tag.endswith('Description'):\n        print(f\"{child.tag}: {child.text}\")\n\n\n{http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/}ShortName: Sentinel-1\n{http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/}Description: Sentinel-1 Collection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting XML file provides full list of the parameters for the collection, with their very brief descriptions."

    "section": "General information",
    "text": "General information\nThis documentation provides an overview of the OnDemand Processing (ODP) API, which is based on the Open Data Protocol (OData) standard. The ODP API provides a RESTful interface for accessing data and metadata from the Copernicus data catalogue. Access to the API is limited by the Authentication service. Quotas are assigned according to the user typology and include limits on number of concurrent orders and available processing workflows. The API allows discovery of all available workflows which can be run in the CDSE platform, indicating which data types can be processed, what are the available parameters and output modes.\n\nAPI Endpoint\nThe ODP API endpoint is https://odp.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1. The endpoint supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\nOpenAPI documentation is located at https://odp.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/docs\n\n\nAPI Operations\nThe ODP API supports the following operations: - GET: This operation is used to retrieve data and metadata from the ODP. The GET operation supports various query options to filter, order, and limit the data retrieved. - POST: This operation is used to create new entities in the ODP. The POST operation requires a payload in JSON format that specifies the properties of the new entity. - PATCH: This operation is used to update existing entities in the ODP. The PATCH operation requires a payload in JSON format that specifies the properties of the entity to update. - DELETE: This operation is used to delete existing entities from the ODP. The DELETE operation requires the URL of the entity to delete. - ### API Resources\nThe ODP API provides access to the following resources: - Workflow: predefined processor which creates a single output product or series of products based on the input parameters provided by the user. Typical inputs are name of the source product and parameters specific to the processing chain. - Production Order: request for production using a Workflow chosen by the user. - Batch Order: request for production of multiple products using a chosen Workflow. - Order Item: single processing job within and Production Order or Batch Order.\n\n\nAuthentication\nTo access the ODP API you need an authorization token as only authorized users are allowed to interact with the processing service. To get the token you can use the following script:\nexport KEYCLOAK_TOKEN=$(curl -d 'client_id=cdse-public' \\\n-d 'username=&lt;LOGIN&gt;' \\\n-d 'password=&lt;PASSWORD&gt;' \\\n-d 'grant_type=password' \\\n'https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token' | \\\npython -m json.tool | grep \"access_token\" | awk -F\\\" '{print $4}')\nOnce you have your token, you can execute request to the API including the token in the request header. For example to list available Workflows you can use the following command:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $KEYCLOAK_TOKEN\" \\ 'https://odp.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Workflows'\nMore information on the tokens and authentication can be found here: https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/OData.html#product-download"

Users can request raw satellite data, simple band combinations such as false colour composites, calculations of simple remote sensing indices like NDVI, or more advanced processing such as calculation of Leaf area index (LAI).\nEven though satellite imagery data are often distributed in \"tiles\", we do not want users to be limited to these. Tiles are an artificially introduced entity to make data distribution easier to handle. However, users should not have to care about whether their AOI is on one tile or another, or perhaps on the border of two tiles. This is why Sentinel Hub API hides this complexity and simply makes the data available over chosen area of interest and temporal period of interest. Tiles are therefore automatically stitched together based on defined parameters (AOI, time period, cloud coverage, priority, etc., depending on the data type)."

Only and is currently supported as a logical operator. Be careful - different collections have different properties for the query filter available. The information describing this is available inside the documentation for each specific collection (ex. Sentinel-1 GRD).\n\n\nFields\nBy default, the search endpoint returns all the available attributes of each item. The fields extension provides a way for the client to specify which attributes should not be part of the output, making it easy for the client to not have to deal with unnecessary data.\nSyntax for the fields is:\n{\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"include\": [\n      \"&lt;property_name_1&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;property_name_2&gt;\"\n    ],\n    \"exclude\": [\n      \"&lt;property_name_3&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;property_name_4&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;property_name_5&gt;\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nInclude/Exclude behaviour\n\nWhen no fields attribute is specified in the request, all the available attributes will be included in the response.\nIf the fields attribute is specified with an empty object, or both include and exclude are set to null or an empty array is returned, the attributes for each item will be as if include was set to a default set of [\"id\", \"type\", \"geometry\", \"bbox\", \"links\", \"assets\", \"properties.datetime\"].\nIf only include is specified, the attributes in include will be merged with the default set above.\nIf only exclude is specified, the attributes in exclude will be removed from the default set above.\nIf both include and exclude are specified, the rule is that an attribute must be included in and not excluded from the response.\n\n\n\n\nDistinct\nSometimes we don't want to search for product metadata, but want some general information about the product, such as for example, which acquisition dates are available for Sentinel-1 inside the specified bbox and time interval. distinct attribute inside a search request makes this possible.\nSyntax for distinct attribute is:\n{\n  \"distinct\": \"&lt;property_name&gt;\"\n}\nAs with the filter attribute, distinct is also a collection limited to some specific properties. Information describing these properties can be found inside each collection's documentation (ex. Sentinel-1 GRD)."

Defaults to SIMPLE.\n\n\nInput object properties\n\nbands - an array of strings representing band names\nunits (optional) - a string (all bands will use this unit) or an array of strings listing the units of each band. For a description of units see the documentation of the collection you are querying. Defaults to the default units for each band.\nmetadata (optional) - an array of strings representing properties which can be added to the metadata. Options:\n\n\"bounds\" - specifying this will add dataGeomtery and dataEnvelope to tiles\n\n\n\n\nOutput object properties\n\nid (optional) - any string of your choosing. Must be unique if multiple output objects are defined. Defaults to default.\nbands - the number of bands in this output.\nsampleType (optional) - sets the SampleType constant defining the returned raster sample type. Defaults to AUTO.\nnodataValue (optional) - sets the GDAL nodata metadata tag to the specified value. Only applicable for tiff files.\n\nNote that the number of bands represent the number of components in the output image. JPEG and PNG, for example, can only support 1 or 3 color components (plus an alpha channel for PNG, if set). The sampleType also needs to be compatible with the output raster format.\n\n\nMosaicking\nMosaicking defines how the source data is mosaicked. Not all collections support all these mosaicking types as it depends on how the source data is distributed. See the collection information pages to determine which ones are supported. It is a constant which is specified by a string. To use, for example, set: mosaicking: \"SIMPLE\".\n\nSIMPLE (default) - the simplest method, it flattens the mosaicked image so only a single sample is passed to evaluation. \nORBIT - the mosaicked image is flattened for each orbit so that there is only one sample per pixel per orbit. Multiple samples can therefore be present if there is more than one orbit for the selected time range at the pixel location.\nTILE - this is essentially the unflattened mosaic. It contains all data available for the selected time range. Multiple samples can be present as each sample comes from a single scene. What a scene is is defined by the datasource. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nORBIT mosaicking currently does not work exactly as described but generates a single scene for each day containing satellite data. For most requests this should not be an issue, however high latitude regions may have more than one acquisition per day. For these consider using TILE mosaicking if getting all available data is paramount. This will be corrected in future releases.\n\n\n\n\nSampleType\nSampleType defines the sample type of the output raster. This needs to be compatible with the raster format (e.g. JPEG cannot be FLOAT32). It is a constant which is specified by a string. To use, for example, set: sampleType: \"AUTO\".\n\nINT8 - signed 8-bit integer (values should range from -128 to 127)\nUINT8 - unsigned 8-bit integer (values should range from 0 to 255)\nINT16 - signed 16-bit integer (values should range from -32768 to\n\n\n\nUINT16 - unsigned 16-bit integer (values should range from 0 to\n\n\n\nFLOAT32 - 32-bit floating point (values have effectively no limits)\nAUTO (default) - values should range from 0-1, which will then automatically be stretched from the interval [0, 1] to [0, 255] and written into an UINT8 raster. Values below 0 and above 1 will be clamped to 0 and 255, respectively. This is the default if sampleType is not set in the output object.\n\nHandling SampleType in an Evalscript\nIt is the responsibility of the evalscript to return the values in the interval expected for the chosen sampleType. For integer SampleTypes, any floating point values will be rounded to the nearest integer and clamped to the value range of the SampleType. There is no need to do this yourself. For example, in case of UINT8 output, a value of 40.6 will be saved as 41, and a value of 310 will be saved as 255. If no sampleType is specified, AUTO is selected and the evalscript should return values ranging from 0-1. This is convenient as handling reflectance (e.g. Sentinel-2) data can be more intuitive.\n\n\n\nExamples\nThis simple Sentinel-2 setup() function gets bands B02, B03, B04 and returns (UINT16) 16 bit unsigned raster values.\nfunction setup() {\n  return {\n    input: [{\n      bands: [\"B02\", \"B03\", \"B04\"], // this sets which bands to use\n      units: \"DN\" // here we optionally set the units. All bands will be in this unit (in this case Digital numbers)\n    }],\n    output: { // this defines the output image type\n      bands: 3, // the output of this evalscript will have RGB colors\n      sampleType: \"UINT16\" // raster format will be UINT16\n    }\n  };\n}\nThis Sentinel-2 setup() function gets bands B02, B03, B04 and returns a single raster with 8-bit integer values. To return values in the correct interval for the UINT8 sampleType, the evaluatePixel() function multiplies the reflectance values by 255. A true color image is returned.\nfunction setup() {\n  return {\n    input: [{\n      bands: [\"B02\", \"B03\", \"B04\"], // this sets which bands to use\n    }],\n    output: {\n      bands: 3,\n      sampleType: \"UINT8\" // raster format will be UINT8\n    }\n  };\n}\nfunction evaluatePixel(sample) {\n  return [sample.B04 * 255, sample.B03 * 255, sample.B02 * 255]; // bands need to be multiplied by 255\n}\nIn case of UINT16, the multiplication factor in evaluatePixel() would be 65535 instead of 255.\nThe following example uses bands with different units and produces two rasters:\nfunction setup() {\n    return {\n      input: [{\n          bands: [\"B02\", \"B03\", \"B04\", \"B08\"],\n          units: [\"reflectance\", \"reflectance\", \"reflectance\", \"DN\"] // B08 will be in digital numbers, the rest reflectance\n      }],\n      output: [{ // this is now an array since there are multiple output objects\n          id: \"rgb\"\n          bands: 3\n      }, {\n          id: \"falseColor\"\n          bands: 3\n      }]\n    }\n}"

The property names equal the names of all the input bands, pixel values of a band can be accessed as e.g. samples.B02.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen using mosaicking SIMPLE we usually call this parameter sample in our examples to emphasize that it is an object and not an array.\n\n\n\nWhen mosaicking is TILE or ORBIT:\n\nsamples - an array of samples as defined in the SIMPLE case. None1, one or multiple samples can therefore be present depending on how many orbits/tiles there are for the selected time range and area of interest. Pixel values of a band can be accessed for each sample as an item of the array, e.g. samples[0].B02.\n\n\n\n\nscenes\n\nWhen mosaicking is SIMPLE:\n\nscenes object is empty.\n\nWhen mosaicking is ORBIT:\n\nscenes - an object containing a property orbits. scenes.orbits is an array of objects, where each of them contains metadata for one orbit (day). The length of scenes.orbits array is always the same as the length of samples array. A property, for example dateFrom, can be accessed as scenes.orbits[0].dateFrom. Each object's properties include:\n\ndateFrom (string) - ISO date and time in \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\" format. Together with orbits.dateTo it represents the time interval of one day. All tiles acquired on this day are mosaicked into this scene.\ndateTo (string) - ISO date and time in \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\" format. Together with orbits.dateFrom it represents the time interval of one day. All tiles acquired on this day are mosaicked into this scene.\ntiles (array) - an array of metadata for each tile used for mosaicking of this orbit. Each element has the same properties as elements of scenes.tiles (listed just below for mosaicking TILE).\n\n\nWhen mosaicking is TILE:\n\nscenes - an object containing a property tiles. scenes.tiles is an array of objects, where each of them contains metadata for one tile. The length of scenes.tiles array is always the same as the length of samples array. A property, for example cloudCoverage, can be accessed as scenes.tiles[0].cloudCoverage. Which properties are available for each tiles element depends on requested data and is documented in the \"Scenes Object\" chapter for each data collection, e.g. here for Sentinel-2 L1C. All possible properties are:\n\ndate (string) - ISO date and time in \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\" format. It represents a date when the tile was acquired.\ncloudCoverage (number) - Estimated percentage of pixels covered by clouds in the tile. This field is not available for all data collections. A value 2.09 means that 2.09% of pixels in the tile are cloudy.\ndataPath (string) - Path to where the tile is stored on a cloud. For example \"s3://sentinel-s2-l2a/tiles/33/T/VM/2020/9/15/0\".\ntileOriginalId (string) - Original filename of the tile or (in case of Sentinel-3 and -5p) a relative path containing the original filename. For example \"S2A_OPER_MSI_L2A_TL_VGS2_20200915T130644_A027332_T33TVM_N02.14\".\ndataGeometry (geojson - like object, see example) - an optional property, added only when requested. Represents a geometry of data coverage within the tile.\ndataEnvelope (geojson - like object, see example) - an optional property, added only when requested. Represents a bbox of dataGeometry.\nshId (number) - Sentinel Hub internal identifier of the tile. For example 11583048.\n\n\n\nNOTE 1: Objects may contain also fields prefixed by __ (double underscore). Such fields are used internally by Sentinel Hub services. Evalscripts should not make use of them because they can be changed or removed at any time and must never modify or delete such fields. Doing so may cause your request to fail or return incorrect results.\nNOTE 2: In the first implementation, scenes was an array of objects, where each of them contained metadata for one orbit or tile (depending on selected mosaicking). It was possible to access metadata as e.g. scenes[0].date. This approach is now deprecated and we strongly advise to use scenes as described above.\n\n\ninputMetadata\ninputMetadata is an object containing metadata used for processing by Sentinel Hub. Its properties are:\n\nserviceVersion - the version of Sentinel Hub which was used for processing.\nnormalizationFactor - the factor used by Sentinel Hub to convert digital numbers (DN) to reflectance using REFLECTANCE = DN * normalizationFactor. This is useful when requesting bands for which both units - DN and REFLECTANCE - are supported.\n\n\n\ncustomData\ncustomData is an object reserved for possible future use.\n\n\noutputMetadata\noutputMetadata is an object which can be used to output any user defined metadata including passing scenes objects, user defined thresholds or ids of original tiles used for processing. It contains:\n\nuserData - is a property to which you can assign a generic object that can contain any data. This can be pushed to the API response by adding a userdata identified output response object to your API request (see this for details or an example here).\n\n\n\n\nReturns\nThe evaluatePixel function can return:\n\nAn object whose keys are the output ids and its values are arrays of numbers. The length of the array is bound by the output object bands number and the values by sampleType.\nAn array of numbers with the same rules as above. This option can be used only when a single image output is defined.\nNothing; the return statement is not specified. This is useful when only information in outputMetadata.userData is needed.\n\n\nInput Units and Output Values\nThe values of each sample is the units specified in the input object. See the input object documentation for more information. How the output values are written to the output raster depends on the sample type. AUTO will stretch values in the interval [0, 1] to [0, 255] and then write those values into an UINT8 raster. The remaining sample types expect values within the range of the sample format.\n\n\n\nExamples\nExample evaluatePixel script returns a simple True Color image based on bands B04, B03, B02:\nfunction evaluatePixel(sample) {\n  return [2.5 * sample.B04, 2.5 * sample.B03, 2.5 * sample.B02];\n}\nWhen we have multiple outputs in the setup function we can provide them as such:\nfunction evaluatePixel(sample) {\n  return {\n    trueColor: [2.5 * sample.B04, 2.5 * sample.B03, 2.5 * sample.B02],\n    falseColor: [2.5 * sample.B08, 2.5 * sample.B04, 2.5 * sample.B03]\n  };\n}\nCalculate the average value of band B04 when using ORBIT or TILE mosaicking:\nfunction evaluatePixel(samples) {\n  var sum = 0;\n  var nonZeroSamples = 0;\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; samples.length; i++) {\n    var value = samples[i].B04;\n    if (value != 0) {\n      sum += value;\n      nonZeroSamples++;\n    }\n  }\n  return [sum / nonZeroSamples];\n}"

The number of bands of each output is stored under output.&lt;output id&gt;.bands where &lt;output id&gt; is equal to values in the setup.output object.

All of this is specified in the body of a request. We would then like to return all available scenes as bands of an output file. Since we generally do not know how many scenes are available, we can not set the number of output bands directly in a setup function.

Use it when mosaicking is set to ORBIT or TILE. It provides additional filtering functionality for scenes, after the constraints set in the request parameters are already applied. This is useful, for example, to reduce the number of scenes needed, thereby reducing processing time and the number of processing units for the request.\n\nParameters\nThese are the full parameters of the preProcessScenes function:\nfunction preProcessScenes(collections)\n\ncollections\ncollections is an object, which contains different properties depending on which mosaicking option is selected.\n\nIf mosaicking is ORBIT, collections contains:\n\nfrom (type Date) - the value given as timeRange.from in the body of the request, representing the start of the search interval\nto (type Date) - the value given as timeRange.to in the body of the request, representing the end of the search interval\nscenes.orbits - corresponds to scenes.orbits as described for evalautePixel function and mosaicking ORBIT here but it doesn't contain tiles.\n\nIf mosaicking is TILE, collections contains:\n\nscenes.tiles - corresponds to scenes.tiles as described for evalautePixel function and mosaicking TILE here.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\nThe preProcessScenes function must return an objects of the same type as collections. Most often, a sub-set of the input collections will be returned, e.g. to keep only the data acquired before 1.2.2019:\nfunction preProcessScenes(collections){\n    collections.scenes.orbits = collections.scenes.orbits.filter(function (scene) {\n        return new Date(scene.dateFrom) &lt; new Date(\"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z\")\n    });\n    return collections\n}\n\n\nExamples\n\nFilter scenes by particular days\nIn this example, we use preProcessScenes function to select images acquired on two particular dates within the requested timeRange. This example was taken (and adopted) from the evalscript for delineation of burned areas, based on the comparison of Sentinel-2 images acquired before (i.e. on \"2017-05-15\") and after (i.e. on \"2017-06-24\") the event.\n\nIf mosaicking is ORBIT:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    var allowedDates = [\"2017-05-15\", \"2017-06-24\"]; //before and after Knysna fires\n    collections.scenes.orbits = collections.scenes.orbits.filter(function (orbit) {\n        var orbitDateFrom = orbit.dateFrom.split(\"T\")[0];\n        return allowedDates.includes(orbitDateFrom);\n    })\n    return collections\n}\n\n\nIf mosaicking is TILE:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    var allowedDates = [\"2017-05-15\", \"2017-06-24\"]; //before and after Knysna fires\n    collections.scenes.tiles = collections.scenes.tiles.filter(function (tile) {\n        var tileDate = tile.date.split(\"T\")[0];\n        return allowedDates.includes(tileDate);\n    })\n    return collections\n}\n\n\n\nFilter scenes by time interval\nHere, we filter out (= remove) all the scenes acquired between the two selected dates, which both fall within the requested time range.\n\nIf mosaicking is ORBIT:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    collections.scenes.orbits = collections.scenes.orbits.filter(function (orbit) {\n        return (new Date(orbit.dateFrom) &lt; new Date(\"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z\")) ||\n               (new Date(orbit.dateFrom) &gt;= new Date(\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\"))\n    })\n    return collections\n}\n\n\nIf mosaicking is TILE:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    collections.scenes.tiles = collections.scenes.tiles.filter(function (tile) {\n        return (new Date(tile.date) &lt; new Date(\"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z\")) ||\n               (new Date(tile.date) &gt;= new Date(\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\"))\n    })\n    return collections\n}\n\n\n\nSpecify the number of months taken into account\nValues of timeRange.from and timeRange.to parameters as given in the request, are available in the preProcessScenes function as collections.to and collections.from, respectively. Mosaicking must be ORBIT to use these parameters. They can be used to e.g. filter out scenes acquired more than 3 months before the given to date and time.\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    collections.scenes.orbits = collections.scenes.orbits.filter(function (orbit) {\n        var orbitDateFrom = new Date(orbit.dateFrom)\n        return orbitDateFrom.getTime() &gt;= (collections.to.getTime()-3*31*24*3600*1000);\n    })\n    return collections\n}\nThe 3*31*24*3600*1000 represents the 3 months converted to milliseconds. This is needed, so that a 3-month time span can be compared to scene.dateFrom and collections.to, which are all returned as milliseconds since 1970-1-1 by the getTime() function. Note: The result is the same as if the timeRange.from parameter in the body of the request is set to 3 months prior to the timeRange.to.\n\n\nSelect one image per month\nIn this example, we filter the available scenes, so that only the first scene acquired in each month is sent to the evaluatePixel function:\n\nIf mosaicking is ORBIT:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    collections.scenes.orbits.sort(function (s1, s2) {\n            var date1 = new Date(s1.dateFrom);\n            var date2 = new Date(s2.dateFrom);\n            return date1 - date2}) // sort the scenes by dateFrom in ascending order\n\n    firstOrbitDate = new Date(collections.scenes.orbits[0].dateFrom)\n    var previousOrbitMonth = firstOrbitDate.getMonth() - 1\n    collections.scenes.orbits = collections.scenes.orbits.filter(function (orbit) {\n        var currentOrbitDate = new Date(orbit.dateFrom)\n        if (currentOrbitDate.getMonth() != previousOrbitMonth){\n            previousOrbitMonth = currentOrbitDate.getMonth();\n            return true;\n        } else return false;\n    })\n    return collections\n}\n\n\nIf mosaicking is TILE:\nfunction preProcessScenes (collections) {\n    collections.scenes.tiles.sort(function (s1, s2) {\n            var date1 = new Date(s1.date);\n            var date2 = new Date(s2.date);\n            return date1 - date2}) // sort the scenes by dateFrom in ascending order\n\n    firstTileDate = new Date(collections.scenes.tiles[0].date)\n    var previousTileMonth = firstTileDate.getMonth() - 1\n    collections.scenes.tiles = collections.scenes.tiles.filter(function (scene) {\n        var currentTileDate = new Date(scene.date)\n        if (currentTileDate.getMonth() != previousTileMonth){\n            previousTileMonth = currentTileDate.getMonth();\n            return true;\n        } else return false;\n    })\n    return collections\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In order to ensure the stability of the system and to guarantee good performance for all users we have to protect it against deliberate attacks or runaway scripts. Every request which reaches our system will therefore go through a rate limiting filter. As long as the agreed upon rate limiting policies are conformed to, responses by our services shall be delivered in timely fashion. On the other hand, requests which violate any of the agreed upon policies will be responded to with a HTTP 429 response.\nWe are able to adjust rate limit policies for each individual user so do contact our Support for specific requirements.\n\nRate limiting policy\nA rate limiting policy defines either how many processing units or HTTP requests can be used per given time period or in total. Both processing units and requests are rate limited and the level of rate limiting depends on your account (see pricing plans).\nAn API is usually protected by multiple rate limiting policies. For example, Processing API has both a processing unit and request rate limiting policies. To conform to the rate limiter, all rate limiting policies have to be satisfied. For example, lets say you have a policy of 100 requests per minute and a policy of 100 processing units per minute. By issuing 100 requests from each every request is valued at 2 processing units in one minute, only 50 requests will pass, all others will fail with HTTP status 429. Even though you have a limit of 100 requests per minute, 50 requests would violate the 100 processing units per minute policy and thus be rate limited.\nUnused processing units and requests do not accumulate. If you have a rate limit policy with 100 request per minute and you don't consume any request for a longer period you are still able to do just 100 requests within the next minute.\n\n\nRate limiting ramp up\nFor all SH subscriptions, the rate limiting is configured also on a \"per minute\" basis (i.e. 600 requests per minute and 1000 processing units per minute for the Enterprise S subscription). For optimal performance, it is best to spread this number of requests over a whole minute, i.e. to send one request every 0.1 seconds. As we understand that this might be difficult to do, we allow some variation from this optimum. However, if you will burst the full number of requests at once, some of them will be rate limited. For such requests, we recommend that you simply resend them - the process should reach the optimal level in a few minutes.\n\n\nResponse Headers\nAll requests going through rate limiting include headers to allow for programmatic adaption to Rate Limiting:\n\nRetry-After: Time in milliseconds until the next request is available.\n\n\nExample:\n\nResponse code and message\n{\n  \"status\": 429,\n  \"reason\": \"Too Many Requests\",\n  \"message\": \"You have exceeded your rate limit\",\n  \"code\": \"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\"\n}\n\n\nResponse header\n{\n  \"Date\": \"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 13:15:02 GMT\",\n  \"retry-after\": \"3398\",\n  ...\n}\nThe HTTP status code in this example is 429 meaning that the request was rate limited. The value of the Retry-After header is 3398, which means that next request will be available in 3398 ms.\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\nWe have set up a test user with two very restrictive rate limiting policies:\n\n10 requests per minute and\n10 processing units per minute\n\nYou can use its instance (for OGC requests) or Oauth client credentials (for API requests) to test how our rate limiting works and for integration purposes.\nAn example of a WMS request using the test user's instance:\n\n[https://services.sentinel-hub.com/ogc/wms/7702fda8-f583-4ae0-a581-1b34e7a6d350](https://services.sentinel-hub.com/ogc/wms/7702fda8-f583-4ae0-a581-1b34e7a6d350){target=“_blank”}?\n\nThe test user's Oauth client credentials below can be used to get an access token, which can then be included in header of a process API requests (for examples of requests see here):\n\nClient id: fa02a066-fc80-4cb4-af26-aae0af26cbf1 Client secret: rate_limit_secret\n\nNote that many people may be using it at the same moment so there is a chance that it will be over the limit more or less all the time. Its purpose is to evaluate response headers anyway.\n\n\nTips to Avoid Being Rate Limited\n\nCaching\nStore API responses that you expect to use a lot. For example, don’t call same requests on every page load but try to store responses in local storage.\n\n\nRequest only what you need\nBe defensive in fetching and try to request only the data that you actually need.\n\n\nExponential backoff\nWhen your limits have been exceeded, we recommend implementing retries with a exponential backoff. An exponential backoff means that you wait for exponentially longer intervals between each retry of a single failing request."

The definition of 1 processing unit and the calculation rules are summarized in the following tables:\n\n\n\nParameter/API\nQuantity for 1 PU\nRules for multiplication factors\n\n\n\n\nArea of interest\n512 x 512 px\nThe multiplication factor is calculated by dividing requested input size (BBOX) by 512 x 512 (pixel size depends on the user-defined resolution of the request execution).  The minimum value of this multiplication factor is 0.01. This corresponds to an area of 0.25 km^2 for Sentinel-2 data at 10 m spatial resolution.\n\n\nNumber of input bands\n3\nThe multiplication factor is calculated by dividing the requested number of input bands by 3. An exception is requesting dataMask which is not counted, unless it is the only band included.\n\n\nOutput format\n8 bit or 16 bit TIFF/JPG/PNG\nRequesting 32 bit float TIFF will result in a multiplication factor of 2 due to larger memory consumption and data traffic.  Requesting application/octet-stream will result in a multiplication factor of 1.4 due to additional integration costs (This is used for integration with external tools such as xcube.).\n\n\nNumber of data samples\n1\nThe multiplication factor equals the number of data samples per pixel.\n\n\n** Data fusion\nN/A\n** The multiplication is only applied when data fusion is used. Multiplication factor is calculated as a sum of all collections within the same endpoint location and twice the sum of all remote collections, i.e. count(local_collections) + 2x count(remote_collections). Example: data fusion request executed on services.sentinel-hub.com endpoint, which includes Sentinel-2 L1C, Sentinel-2 L2A and Landsat-9 would have a multiplication factor of 4 (1 + 1 + 2)."

    "title": "Authentication",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Sentinel Hub API uses OAuth2 Authentication and requires that you have an access token. In essence, this is a piece of information you add to your requests so the server knows it's you. These tokens do not last forever for a multitude of reasons, but you can get new ones and when they expire from the Sentinel-Hub OAuth2 server at the token endpoint listed below. But first, if you do not have one already, you need to register an OAuth Client in your account settings. This is so the server can expect you to make such token requests.\n\nHow to use tokens\nOnce you have a token, do use it for authenticating all your requests within its validity period. While tokens do not last forever, they do last a reasonable amount of time, and sufficiently long that they can be reused. The information of how long each token lasts is embedded in the token itself in the exp claim, and can be read from there.\nDo not fetch a new token for each API request you make. Token requests are rate limited, so if you are getting an HTTP 429 error, that means you are requesting too many tokens.\nTokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT), more information about them here or here.\n\n\nRegistering OAuth client\nTo register an OAuth client, open the \"User Settings\" tab in your dashboard, then click the Create new button (1) in the \"OAuth client\" section. Give your OAuth client a name (2), set the Client grant type to Client Credentials, and click the Create client button (3). Your client secret will be displayed. Copy the secret value (4) and paste it locally, as it will not be visible after the pop-up window closes! When you are finished, click Close (5). You should now see the newly created OAuth client name and ID (6) in the list of your OAuth clients. With client ID and client secret, you are now ready to request tokens.\n\nTo request tokens the easiest way is to have some software which understands OAuth2 and can make the proper request. For example, REST clients like Postman and Insomnia have support for OAuth2 Client credentials already included. See the Token Request Examples section below.\n\n\nOAuth2 Endpoints\nToken Endpoint - for requesting tokens\nhttps://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token\n\n\nToken Request Examples\n\ncURL\nThe following cURL request will return an access token, just make sure to replace &lt;your client id&gt; with your client ID and &lt;your client secret&gt; with your client secret:\ncurl --request POST --url https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token --header \"content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" --data \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=&lt;your client id&gt;\" --data-urlencode \"client_secret=&lt;your client secret&gt;\"\n\n\nPostman\nIn the Postman request Authorization tab set the Type to OAuth 2.0 and Add the authorization data to Request Headers. Then click the Get New Access Token button. Set the Grant Type to Client Credentials, the access token URL to the token endpoint, then set the Client ID and Client Secret to the values of your OAuth Client. Scope can be blank. Keep Client Authentication as Send As Basic Auth Header. Click Request Token. You should get a new one immediately. To use this token to authorize your request, click Use Token. For more information see the Postman authorization documentation\n\n\nPython\nIn python the requests-oauthlib library can handle the retrieval of access tokens using your OAuth Client configuration.\nfrom oauthlib.oauth2 import BackendApplicationClient\nfrom requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session\n\n# Your client credentials\nclient_id = '&lt;client_id&gt;'\nclient_secret = '&lt;secret&gt;'\n\n# Create a session\nclient = BackendApplicationClient(client_id=client_id)\noauth = OAuth2Session(client=client)\n\n# Get token for the session\ntoken = oauth.fetch_token(token_url='https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token',\n                          client_secret=client_secret)\n\n# All requests using this session will have an access token automatically added\nresp = oauth.get(\"...\")\nprint(resp.content)\nrequests-oauthlib doesn't check for status before checking if the response is ok. In case there's a server error, the user can receive an incorrect error, which falsely makes it seem as if the issue is on client side. Library's compliance hooks will prevent the invalid status response from being ignored, returning the correct error. To use them, add the following code:\ndef sentinelhub_compliance_hook(response):\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    return response\n\noauth.register_compliance_hook(\"access_token_response\", sentinelhub_compliance_hook)\n\n\nJavascript\nExample using axios.\nimport axios from \"axios\"\nimport qs from \"qs\"\n\nconst client_id = \"&lt;client_id&gt;\"\nconst client_secret = \"&lt;secret&gt;\"\n\nconst instance = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu\"\n})\n\nconst config = {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8'\n  }\n}\n\nconst body = qs.stringify({\n  client_id,\n  client_secret,\n  grant_type: \"client_credentials\"\n})\n\n\n// All requests using this instance will have an access token automatically added\ninstance.post(\"https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token\", body, config).then(resp =&gt; {\n  Object.assign(instance.defaults, {headers: {authorization: `Bearer ${resp.data.access_token}`}})\n})"

Required.\n\n\nTIME\n(when REQUEST = GetTile) The time range for which to return the results. The result is based on all scenes between the specified times conforming to the cloud coverage criteria and stacked based on priority setting - e.g. most recent on top. It is written as two time values in ISO8601 format separated by a slash, for example: TIME=2016-01-01T09:02:44Z/2016-02-01T11:00:00Z. Reduced accuracy times, where parts of the time string are omitted, are also supported. For example, TIME=2016-07-15/2016-07-15 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-15T00:00:00Z/2016-07-15T23:59:59Z\" and TIME=2016-07/2016-08 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-01T00:00:00Z/2016-08-31T23:59:59Z\"  Optional, default: none (the last valid image is returned).  Note: Requesting a single value for TIME parameter is deprecated. Sentinel Hub interpreted it as a time interval [given time - 6 months, given time]. For vast majority of cases this resulted in unnecessary long processing time thus we strongly encourage you to always use the smallest possible time range instead.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the standard WFS URL parameters, the WFS service also supports many custom URL parameters.

Optional, default: \"1.1.2\". Supported values: \"1.0.0\" and \"1.1.2\".\n\n\nREQUEST\nWhat is requested, valid values: GetCoverage, DescribeCoverage or GetCapabilities. Required.\n\n\nTIME\n(when REQUEST = GetTile) The time range for which to return the results. The result is based on all scenes between the specified times conforming to the cloud coverage criteria and stacked based on priority setting - e.g. most recent on top. It is written as two time values in ISO8601 format separated by a slash, for example: TIME=2016-01-01T09:02:44Z/2016-02-01T11:00:00Z. Reduced accuracy times, where parts of the time string are omitted, are also supported. For example, TIME=2016-07-15/2016-07-15 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-15T00:00:00Z/2016-07-15T23:59:59Z\" and TIME=2016-07/2016-08 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-01T00:00:00Z/2016-08-31T23:59:59Z\"  Optional, default: none (the last valid image is returned).  Note: Requesting a single value for TIME parameter is deprecated. Sentinel Hub interpreted it as a time interval [given time - 6 months, given time]. For vast majority of cases this resulted in unnecessary long processing time thus we strongly encourage you to always use the smallest possible time range instead.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the standard WCS URL parameters, the WCS service also supports many custom URL parameters. See Custom service URL parameters for details.\nStandard GetCoverage request URL parameters:\n\n\n\nWCS parameter\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nCOVERAGE\nThe preconfigured (in the instance) layer for which to generate the output image, or \"TILE\" to return the vector format features.\n\n\nFORMAT\nThe returned image format. Optional, default: \"image/png\", other options: \"image/jpeg\", \"image/tiff\". Detailed information about supported values.\n\n\n\nStandard DescribeCoverage request URL parameters:\n\n\n\nWCS parameter\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nComing soon..."

Optional, default: \"1.0.0\". Supported values: \"1.0.0\".\n\n\nREQUEST\nWhat is requested, valid values: GetTile or GetCapabilities. Required.\n\n\nTIME\n(when REQUEST = GetTile) The time range for which to return the results. The result is based on all scenes between the specified times conforming to the cloud coverage criteria and stacked based on priority setting - e.g. most recent on top. It is written as two time values in ISO8601 format separated by a slash, for example: TIME=2016-01-01T09:02:44Z/2016-02-01T11:00:00Z. Reduced accuracy times, where parts of the time string are omitted, are also supported. For example, TIME=2016-07-15/2016-07-15 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-15T00:00:00Z/2016-07-15T23:59:59Z\" and TIME=2016-07/2016-08 will be interpreted as \"TIME=2016-07-01T00:00:00Z/2016-08-31T23:59:59Z\"  Optional, default: none (the last valid image is returned).  Note: Requesting a single value for TIME parameter is deprecated. Sentinel Hub interpreted it as a time interval [given time - 6 months, given time]. For vast majority of cases this resulted in unnecessary long processing time thus we strongly encourage you to always use the smallest possible time range instead.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the standard WMS URL parameters, the WMS service also supports many custom URL parameters. See Custom service URL parameters for details.\nStandard GetTile request URL parameters:\n\n\n\nWMTS parameter\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nTILEMATRIXSET\nThe matrix set to be used for the output tile. Check GetCapabilities for a list of supported matrix sets.\n\n\nTILEMATRIX\nThe matrix to be used for the output tile. Check GetCapabilities for a list of supported matrices.\n\n\nTILECOL\nThe column index of the output tile. Check GetCapabilities for a list of supported matrix widths.\n\n\nTILEROW\nThe row index of the output tile. Check GetCapabilities for a list of supported matrix heights.\n\n\nLAYER\nThe preconfigured (in the instance) layer for which to generate the output tile.\n\n\nFORMAT\nThe returned image format. Optional, default: \"image/png\", other options: \"image/jpeg\", \"image/tiff\". Detailed information about supported values."

However, there are some specifics when using evalscripts with the Statistical API:\n\nThe evaluatePixel() function must, in addition to other output, always return also dataMask output. This output defines which pixels are excluded from calculations. For more details and an example, see here.\nThe default value of sampleType is FLOAT32.\nThe output.bands parameter in the setup() function can be an array. This makes it possible to specify custom names for the output bands and different output dataMask for different outputs, see this example."

    "section": "API's features",
    "text": "API's features\n\nSplit requested timeRange into multiple time intervals\nThe Statistical API supports requesting statistics for multiple time intervals with only one request. For example, requesting the aggregationInterval and timeRange as:\n...\n\"timeRange\": {\n    \"from\": \"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"to\": \"2020-07-31T00:00:00Z\"\n    },\n\"aggregationInterval\": {\n    \"of\": \"P10D\"\n}\n...\nreturns the requested statistics calculated for multiple 10-day intervals, see this example. The aggregation intervals should be at least one day long (e.g. \"P5D\", \"P30D\"). You can only use period OR time designator not both.\nIf a timeRange is not divisible by an aggregationInterval, the last (\"not full\") time interval will be dismissed by default (SKIP option). The user can instead set the lastIntervalBehavior to SHORTEN (shortens the last interval so that it ends at the end of the provided time range) or EXTEND (extends the last interval over the end of the provided time range so that all the intervals are of equal duration).\nNote that the data is mosaicked for each of the time intervals (as defined with the mosaicking parameter in an evalscript) before the statistics are calculated. To calculate statistics over time (for example, the maximum NDVI value in a month), you should set mosaicking to ORBIT or TILE and calculate the required value in an evalscript, see this example. If you use mosaicking SIMPLE, one mosaicked output for each time interval is a basis for calculating statistics.\n\n\nHistogram\nRequesting histograms is optional. A variety of histogram customisations are available. Users can specify:\n\nnumber of bins nBins or\nwidth of bins binWidthor\narbitrary bins.\n\nThis example demonstrates all three options.\n\n\nPercentile calculations\nIt is possible to get values for any percentile. For example, to get values for 33%, 75%, and 90% percentile, add the \"percentiles\" parameter to your requests as:\n...\n{\n  \"percentiles\": {\n    \"k\": [33, 75, 90]\n  }\n}\n...\nSee also this example.\n\n\nExclude pixels from calculations (dataMask output)\nIt is possible to exclude certain pixels from the calculation of the statistics. The most common use cases are excluding no data and cloudy pixels.\nWith the Statistical API, this is achieved by defining a special output called \"dataMask\". This output should have value \"0\" assigned for the pixels that should be excluded from the calculations, and a value of \"1\" elsewhere. The values of the \"dataMask\" output are defined by the user in an evalscript. An illustrative example is excluding water pixels from statistics of NDVI, see this example.\nNote that the Statistical API does not automatically exclude the no data pixels from calculating the statistics. We recommend that you always exclude those unless there is a good reason not to. This is especially important when you are requesting statistics for a polygon, as it will ensure that pixels outside of the polygon (and inside of the bounding box) are excluded. To exclude no data pixels you need to pass input dataMask band to the dataMask output, e.g.:\nfunction evaluatePixel(samples) {\n    return {\n        ...,\n        dataMask: [samples.dataMask]\n        }\n}\nAll evalscripts in the examples here exclude no data pixels.\n\n\nMultiple outputs and multi bands outputs\nStatistics can be requested for multiple outputs. This is useful when we need to use different dataMasks or different sampleTypes for each output. Additionally, each output can have multiple bands. It is possible to request different statistics for each band and for each output. This example demonstrates how to do all this.\n\n\nExamples\nExamples of Statistical API\n\n\nTutorials and Other Related Materials\n\nTo get you started, we created a detailed beginner webinar on statistical API, where you can learn how to get statistics for your data, how to manipulate the evalscript to return several outputs, each with its own statistical information, how to make use of powerful aggregations, exclude pixels from the calculation, make custom histograms and visualize your statistics in Python."

The VISUALIZE tab will allow you to easily visualize satellite imagery on the map. Change or modify your visualization with just a few clicks.\n\nVisualizing data\nIn order to visualize data on the map, you need to zoom in to your area of interest. You can do this either with the mouse wheel or with the location search in the upper right corner.\nLet’s try to visualize the latest Sentinel-2 L2A imagery over Italy.\n\nEither zoom to Italy with the mouse wheel or type Italy in the search box in the upper right corner.\nIn the sidebar, a maximum cloud coverage of 30% and the product type Sentinel-2 L2A are already preselected. To visualize the latest available data with cloud coverage below 30% click on the Show latest date button.\n\n\nFig 2: VISUALIZE tab with show latest date button and Sentinel-2 L2A collection highlighted\nYou can now see the latest data over Italy on the map. Depending on the latest data available you will see data from one or more orbits (stripes of images on the map).\n\nModifying and Changing a Visualization\nIf you want to improve how the data is displayed on the map, you can modify the visualization by clicking on Show effects and advanced options at the bottom of the sidebar. Change the Gain/Gamma values, the values of the R/G/B colour channels, specify which sampling method is used for the visualization (Layer default, Bilinear, Bicubic, Nearest) or click on Reset to reset all changes made. To return to the visualization layers overview, click on Show visualizations.\nTo visualize different Sentinel-2 band combinations, either use one of the prepared options from the list of layers (e.g., NDVI for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index using the Sentinel bands B4 and B8) or click Custom at the bottom of the layers list.\n\nFig 3: Custom Layers option with Composite Index and Custom script highlighted\nHere you can create a custom R/G/B composite or Index (band ratio, normalized difference index) by dragging and dropping the Sentinel-2 bands into the appropriate circles or use the Custom script functionality to insert a piece of JavaScript code.\n\n\nChanging the Data Collection\nYou can switch visualizing between different data collections by clicking on the arrow next to the Data Collections section in the Visualization tab. Once you click on the arrow as seen in Fig. 4, you will be able to see a drop-down menu with a list of the satellite data that is available. Let us try to visualize Sentinel-3 data of the same location and date as that of the Sentinel-2 data in Visualizing data section.\n1. Click on the drop-down arrow on the right next to Pins icon. 2. Click on the drop-down arrow next to Sentinel-2 and select Sentinel-3. 3. You can select the product you want to visualize. To visualize the Brightness temperature, select Sentinel-3 SLSTR L1B. You can see the predefined layers that can be visualized and click on the green button to Show latest date.\nAt the moment, the Data Collections available for visualization are Sentinel-2 (L1C and L2A), Sentinel-3 (OLCI Level-1 EFT, SLSTR Level-1 RBT) and Sentinel-5P.\n\nFig 4: Changing Data Collection from Visualization tab directly\n\n\nComparing Visualizations\nTo compare two (or more) visualizations you must add them to the compare panel. You can add a visualization to the compare panel by clicking on the Add to compare button in each visualization layer (see Fig. 4). When you have added all the layers you want to compare to the compare panel, you can switch to it by clicking on the compare icon (  ). In the compare panel you can choose between a Split and an Opacity mode. With the Split mode you can compare two images side by side. With the Opacity mode you can compare two (or more) visualizations on top of each other.\n\nFig 5: Add to compare and compare icon\n\n\nSaving Pins\nTo save a visualization for future viewing, you can save it as a pin by clicking on ( ) next to the Layer name and clicking on Add to Pins. You can find the saved pins by clicking on the ( ) icon. If you wish to compare saved pins, you can add them to the compare panel as explained in the previous section. If you have multiple pins saved and want to compare them altogether, you can directly go to the compare panel and add all the pins to compare by clicking on ( ). Another feature of the Browser is that you can export pins as a JSON file and import previously exported pins as well.\n\nFig 6: Add to pins and Pins icon\n\n\n\nProduct Search for Current Visualization\nWhen you are visualizing data (chapter Visualizing data), you can easily find the products associated with the data you see on the map. The product allows you to inspect the full metadata and easily download the raw data. To find connected products, just click the Find products for current view button in the sidebar (under the Show latest date button).\n\nFig 7: Find products for current view button position in the sidebar.\n\n\n3D Visualization\nWith the 3D visualization tool, users can also visualize the terrain. To obtain a 3D visualization, you need to first select a layer to view and then click on the  icon. You can move forward, backward, left, or right by right clicking on the pan console (labelled 1 in the red box in Fig. 8) and rotate around a point by right clicking on the camera console (labelled 2 in the red box in Fig. 8). The viewing angle can be adjusted by scaling vertically and panning in all directions. You can further explore the area by adjusting the sun projected shadows and the shading parameters of the scene in the settings (labelled as box 3 and 4 respectively in Fig. 8). This 3D view can also be downloaded as a PNG or JPEG file. Let us try visualizing Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps. 1. Follow the steps mentioned in Visualizing data chapter to visualize Mont Blanc and select the “True Color” visualization. 2. Click on the  icon placed at the right of the screen. 3. You can navigate around the visualization either with your mouse, keyboard or directly on the map by following the instructions mentioned in the “Help” section (click on the ( ) icon). 4. Click on the Settings icon ( ). Set the Vertical terrain scaling to 150% by moving the slider. 5. To adjust shadows, click on the Parameters next to Sun projected shadows toggle switch. 6. To adjust Shading parameters, click on Edit and modify the Ambient factor, Diffuse factor, Specular factor, and Specular power. 7. You can Reset values at any point to return to the default settings.\n\nFig 8: 3D visualization in the Browser with pop-up Settings windows on the right"

You can explore the metadata for each of those products, download the raw data or visualize the data on the map (currently only Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A are supported, but more data sources will be supported here in the future).\nThe SEARCH tab is located in the sidebar next to the VISUALIZE tab (see Fig. 9).\n\nFig 9: SEARCH tab with different Data Sources, Time range and Search button\n\nHow to find a Product\nTo find products you can either use the keyword search (text input) or select one or more data sources using the checkboxes. To find products for a specific time range only, set the from/to date in the date input boxes. For example, let us find the latest Sentinel-2 L2A image over Italy for the beginning of 2023.\n\nZoom in on Italy on the map with the scroll wheel of your mouse.\nSelect Sentinel-2 &gt; MSI (selected by default) &gt; L2A.\nSet the Time Range to reflect two weeks (e.g., 2023-01-02, 2023-01-16)\nPress the Search button\n\n\nFig 10: SEARCH tab with L2A collection selected and map centred on Rome (Italy)\nYou will now see the first 50 search results for your search settings (Sentinel L2A data over Italy for a time range of 2 weeks) in the sidebar and on the map. To load the next 50 results, click on the Load more button at the end of the list in the sidebar. You can view the metadata of a product in the sidebar or by selecting a product on the map. In both cases you can:\n\nDirectly view the basic metadata (preview image (available for most Sentinel-2 L1C, L2A, Sentinel-3 SLSTR and Sentinel-3 OLCI products), name, mission, instrument, acquisition time)\nView the full metadata by clicking on the product info button ( ) in the results (full metadata)\n\n\nAdditional Filters\nTo get more suitable results, you can also select or choose additional filters as shown in Figure 11. 1. Select the Data Source and the appropriate instrument/ processing level. 2. Click on the Filter button and set the filtering parameters. 3. Press the Search button. Here, you can choose various parameters depending on the chosen Data Source. For example, you can see the filter parameters for Sentinel-1 in Figure 11, letting you filter the results based on satellite platform, orbit direction, relative orbit number, acquisition mode, Beam ID and polarization.\n\nFig 11: Data filters and parameters\n\n\nVisualize the search result\nOnce you find the tiles you need following the above steps, you can visualize this one in of the two ways: by clicking on the region of interest and looking at the tiles that cover the region or select the tile from the Search panel on the left. Below the preview of the tile, there is a button to visualize (  ), which will take you to the Visualize tab.\n\nFig 12: Tile selection and visualization\n\n\n\nHow to download a Product\nWhen you have found a product (see How to find a Product) that you would like to download, you can do so by clicking click on the download icon (  ) for the desired product in the results (in the sidebar or in the results panel on the map after selecting a product). After you click the button, a progress bar will appear below the product to indicate the status of your download. If you have started a download by mistake, you can cancel it by clicking on the “x” below the download button.\nYou can continue to use the app as normal while a product is being downloaded.\n\nFig 13: Product download (in progress) with Download product and cancel button highlighted"

When you are satisfied with your download settings, you will find the  button below the preview:\n\nBasic\n\nYou can use the Show Captions toggle switch to add data source, date, zoom scale and branding information to the exported images.\nYou can also use the Add Map Overlays toggle switch to add place labels, streets and political boundaries to the image or the Show Legend toggle switch to add the legend data.\nYou can use the Crop to AOI toggle switch to crop the image to the bounds of area of interest, if drawn previously.\nIf you want to download the entire image but highlight the AOI, it can be done by enabling the Draw AOI Geometry.\nUse the textbox to add a short description to the exported image.\nChoose between two image formats (JPG, PNG).\nA preview of the image that will be downloaded is displayed under Preview. Previews are available only when you zoom in enough.\n\nAnalytical\n\nAfter preparing the data for download, click the  button to download the image in JPG, PNG, KMZ or GeoTIFF format.\nChoose between different image formats, resolutions and coordinate systems before downloading the image. You can also attach a logo.\nIn the Analytical panel, you can select multiple layers (Visualized/Raw) and download them all in a single ZIP file.\n\nHigh-res print\n\nPrepare the selected visual for high-resolution printing by manually selecting a format, size and DPI. Add captions, legends and descriptions as needed.\n\n\n\n\nTimelapse\nTimelapses are a very popular and useful tool to show how a certain location on Earth changed through time. Using the timelapse tool you can create your own visualization of changes through time and export it as .GIF or .MPEG4 to share it with others online. Let’s create a timelapse of the deforestation in the Brazil from 2018 – 2022. 1. Go to: https://sentinelshare.page.link/osH4 2. Click on the timelapse icon (  ) and click on the play button in the middle of the screen. This opens a pop-up window to create a timelapse. 3. Change the settings on the left side to: a. Dates 2018-01-01 – 2022-12-31 b. Select 1 image per: month Alternatively, you can select only certain months in a year using the filter by months option. Click on Search to see all the results. 4. In the Visualizations set the Min. tile coverage to 100% and the Max. cloud coverage to 2% and manually deselect the images from the 2022-05-30 (slightly cloudy) and the 2022-09-07 (blurry). 5. Once you have the list of images you want to display in the timelapse, select the speed, and transition to prepare your timelapse. 6. Click on the play button to check the result and download the animation as a GIF-file using the Download button for further use online/offline.\n\nFig 14: Browser timelapse tool with settings highlighted\n\nHistogram\nWith the Histogram tool you can display statistical data (the distribution of values) for specific layers by clicking on the  icon. The histogram is calculated for the data within your AOI, if defined or otherwise for the whole screen. This tool currently only works for index layers (e.g., the NDVI).\n\nFig. 15: Example of a distribution plot of NDVI values"

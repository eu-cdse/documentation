# Guidelines for editors

## Hotfix
Hotfixes to the production documentation portal are done by creating a new PR based on the `publish` branch.
Once the PR is reviewed and merged, the hotfix changes are automatically merged to both the `publish` and `staging` branch.

## Other changes
All other changes are made via a PR on the `staging` branch.
After reviewing and merging the PR, the changes are automatically pushed to the `staging`.

## PR commits
Commits within PR are automatically built and rendered to a custom link on the GitHub Pages. 
After a successfull build of the commits, GitHub Actions will post a new comment with a link to custom documentation portal.

## Automated merges
GitHub Actions are set up to automatically merge pull requests into the corresponding branches.
In case of a conflict, automatic merge can fail and manual resolution may be needed.


# openEO specific guidelines

## Shared notebooks

To avoid maintaining generic notebooks in backend/platform specific repositories, we prefer adding notebooks to https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-community-examples .
This repository is imported here using git submodules, allowing Quarto to integrate the notebook content.
A 'filter' (notebook_filter.py) is configured to preprocess the notebooks, for instance to set the correct openEO url.

The caveat is that notebooks need to be properly reviewed to be multi-platform, and changes need to be reviewed as well. Automation can help here to execute the notebooks.

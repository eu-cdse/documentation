On this page, we present a compilation of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the utilization of available data analyzed through the openEO API and the Sentinel Hub API across various use cases. These notebooks are categorized and will expand over time. Written in Python, they are designed to be executed in a Jupyter environment. 

The notebooks serve as a foundational resource for users, offering a starting point to acquaint themselves with the openEO API and the Sentinel Hub API. Users are encouraged to explore these notebooks when developing their workflow.

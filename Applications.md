# Applications

This section provides an overview of the EO Applications available from Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.


## [Browser](/Applications/Browser.md) 

The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Browser serves as a central hub for accessing, exploring and utilizing the wealth of Earth observation and environmental data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel constellations, contributing missions, Auxiliary engineering data, on-demand data and more (Check out the documentation on [Data](/Data.md) for more details) . Based on Sentinel Hub's EO Browser, users can visualise, compare and analyse and download all this data for a variety of applications, from environmental monitoring and disaster management to urban planning and agriculture. Check out the user guide to know more about the features of the Browser and how to use it.

## [openEO algorithm plaza](/Applications/AlgorithmPlaza.qmd)

The openEO algorithm plaza host many algorithms that are built on top of the openEO API. These algorithms also termed as Earth Observation services can be addressed via openEO Web Editor or via API to embed into new services or platforms. Users are granted with credits to explore the available algorithms and check if they are fit for purpose for their needs. The plaza not only allows to explore the services but also enables third party services provider to onboard their algorithms semi-automatically for further exposure. 

## [openEO Web-Editor](Applications/WebEditor.qmd)

The openEO Web Editor is a web app that allows users to interact with an openEO back-end and perform various tasks related to Earth observation data processing. This application can be of great use for users who are not familiar with a programming language. The openEO Web Editor can act as a simple interface for:


* Data Discovery: User can explore and discover available Earth observation datasets.
* Workflow Creation: User can create an openEO processing workflow from basic building blocks in a drag-and-drop interface.
* Workflow Execution: Once User have defined their processing workflow and configured the parameters, User can execute the workflow using the Web Editor. 
* Result Visualization: User can explore the output data on interactive maps, generate charts and graphs 
* Job Management: The Web Editor allows you to monitor your processing jobs, view job histories, and access the generated results.

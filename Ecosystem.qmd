## Overview of the Ecosystem

The attractiveness of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) depends on the platform services and available data, and on the users and 3rd party participants of the system. The objective is to continuously evolve the Ecosystem with:

* New data sets
* New data providers
* New service offerings
* New data processing approaches
* New 3rd party services
* New Ecosystem Adopters
* Etc.

The CDSE is designed and operated as an open ecosystem allowing access to Copernicus data and related processing capabilities and enabling the development of value-added and complementary services by 3rd party service providers.<br> 
As such, the CDSE foresees a wide range of options to benefit from the available resources and services, notably:

*	Access to open and free services available to all users without registration.
*	Access to open and free data and processing services available to all registered CDSE users (or CDSE federated users) with configured access capacity.
*	Access to Ecosystem services including cloud computing services for 3rd parties to deploy and operate their own data and services based on the Copernicus Data.
*	Gradual federation capabilities with other platforms or services, aiming at maximising the synergies across European EO systems and providing users with an easier to use and trusted seamless digital journey when combining services.

3rd party service providers can offer their services benefiting from the available CSDE data and services through an individual self-managed on-boarding process, or for larger communities and platforms through a supported onboarding process that can include options to federate with the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem for enhanced interoperability.<br>
Interested parties and communities that want to federate with the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem are welcomed from any domain including science, public entities, business and start-ups. These can be e.g., service providers (including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and cloud services providers), and external data providers (e.g., national EO mission operators, New Space operators, contributing missions, VHR satellite operators). The level of participation, federation and integration with the Data Space may vary from entity to entity.<br>
An overview of the ecosystem with its starting point, identified participants, 3rd party services and stakeholders for growth is depicted in Figure 1 below. The evolution of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem shall further foster the development and operations of interacting self-standing Earth Observation (EO) services. Customer-Provider relationships in the Ecosystem shall follow international standardisation and provide the needed trust in the EO services by associating security and sovereignty to the data and usage of services. The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem has the perspective to model the process of adoption and development of digital products and services and foster uptake and growth of services in an attractive and competitive environment.<br>

## Evolution

Ensuring sufficient trust in the security and sovereignty of the usage of Ecosystem data and services requires the interaction between users, data and service providers to be based on established transparent processes and standards. EO services have become much more standardized in recent years e.g., using OGC services, common cloud architectures, federated identity management, RESTful APIs etc. These standards are already implemented and being used by the building blocks on which the Copernicus Data Space has been established. However, to further accelerate growth and scalability of an Ecosystem, the standards need to be further extended to facilitate e.g., self-registration, any-to-any relations, and common shared services.<br> 
Moreover, the EO user community has grown familiar with easy-to-use services. For the evolution to be successful, the Ecosystem governance will verify if new concepts and standards being introduced will be effective and efficient for use with EO data, adopted by the user community and overall contribute to make the Ecosystem more attractive and growing faster.

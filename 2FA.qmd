To set up two-factor authentication, you need to first install either FreeOTP or Google Authenticator on your mobile device. Once installed, open the application and scan the provided barcode using the app's scanning feature. If you encounter difficulty scanning the barcode, you can select the "Unable to scan?" option and manually enter the provided key into the authenticator application. After scanning or entering the key, you need to enter the one-time code provided by the application and provide a Device Name for managing your OTP devices. In this example, the Device Name is "Device Name". Finally, click on the "SUBMIT" button to finish the setup.

Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem provides a wide range of applications that can be used to access, process, and visualize Copernicus data. These applications are designed to help users to easily access and use Copernicus data for a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, climate change, disaster management, and more.

Those new to the Copernicus ecosystem can begin by using the [Copernicus Data Space Browser](Applications/Browser.qmd). This platform allows users to easily explore various datasets, employing tools for visualization, comparison, and downloading with ease.

From the browser, you can also access the [Data workspace](Applications/DataWorkspace.qmd), which functions as a tool to aggregate and review products, which can then be further processed or downloaded for various purposes.

As you delve further into the Earth Observation (EO) dataset, you can navigate to the [Catalogue CSV](Applications/Catalogue-csv.qmd) documentation. Here, you'll find more information on Sentinel product lists in CSV format.

Furthermore, suppose you are already familiar with the different kinds of EO data offered and wish to analyse it in the provided workspace. In that case, we encourage you to explore the documentation for the [JupyterLab environment](Applications/JupyterHub.qmd). This tool allows users to run Python code and access the data in a more interactive manner.

Suppose you are interested in a more specific open-source solution for accessing and analysing the EO data. In that case, we recommend you to exploring the [openEO API](APIs/openEO/openEO.qmd) documentation. You can use the openEO Python client in the above mentioned JupyterLab environment. 

Moreover, for users who are intersted in using openEO API in a GUI environment, we recommend you to explore the [openEO Web Editor](Applications/WebEditor.qmd) documentation. This tool allows users to interact with the openEO API in a more visual manner.

Supporting the FAIR and Open Science principles, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, also provides you with a platform to share and use EO algorithms. The [openEO Algorithm Plaza](Applications/AlgorithmPlaza.qmd) documentation provides you with an overview of the platform and how you can use it to share and use EO algorithms.

Did you know the ecosystem also offers you with a QGIS plugin to access and process EO data? The [QGIS Plugin](Applications/QGIS.qmd) documentation provides you with an overview of the plugin and how you can use it in QGIS.

Among the array of applications, there's also the Copernicus Dashboard. Through this public platform, to monitor activities within the ecosystem, keeping track of ongoing updates.

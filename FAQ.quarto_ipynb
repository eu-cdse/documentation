        "    <p>As Copernicus Browser timelapse functionality has a limit of processing up to 300 images at once, we need to do some post-processing, to be able to create longer timelapses.<br><br>\n",
        "    First, use command prompt to convert .gif timelapses from Copernicus Browser into .mp4 files and then merge them together. For example, if we want to create a five-years long timelapse from daily Sentinel-3 data, six timelapses, each 300 days long, are required. You should first download your smaller timelapses from [Copernicus Browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/).<br><br>\n",
        "    After downloading the gifs from Copernicus Browser, we should transform them into .mp4 files. To do so, we first need to download and install the ffmpeg program for making videos. Follow [this tutorial to install ffmpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).<br><br>\n",
        "    *To test if ffmpeg is installed, go to CMD and type: `ffmpeg -version`.*<br><br>\n",
        "    To transform a gif into mp4, first navigate to the folder where your gif files are stored, then open your command prompt and write in the following code:</p>\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF1.gif -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf \"scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2\" GIF1vid.mp4\n",
        "```\n",
        "    *The only part of the code you need to change is the name of your gif at the start and the name of the output .mp4 video at the end.*<br><br>\n",
        "    You need to transform all your .gif time-lapses into separate .mp4 files:\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF1.gif -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf \"scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2\" GIF1vid.mp4<br>\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF2.gif -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf \"scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2\" GIF2vid.mp4<br>\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF3.gif -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf \"scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2\" GIF3vid.mp4\n",
        "```\n",
        "    Finally, merge all the .mp4 files into a final .mp4 file with the following code:\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF1vid.mp4 -i GIF2vid.mp4 -i GIF3vid.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:0] [1:0] [2:0] concat=n=3:v=1:a=0\" FinalVideo.mp4\n",
        "```\n",
        "    In this code, we specify the output name of the final .mp4 timelapse and list the .mp4 files we want to merge. We preface the .mp4 files with -i. Then we need to add as many arrays as there are input .mp4 videos; `[0:0]` for the first one, `[0:1]` for the second one, `[0:3]` for the third one and so on. The `n=3` indicates how many input .mp4 files there are.<br><br>\n",
        "    For 6 input .mp4 files, the code would look like this:\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "ffmpeg -i GIF1vid.mp4 -i GIF2vid.mp4 -i GIF3vid.mp4 -i GIF4vid.mp4 -i GIF5vid.mp4 -i GIF6vid.mp4 - filter_complex \"[0:0][1:0][2:0][3:0][4:0][5:0] concat=n=6:v=1:a=0\" FinalVideo.mp4\n",

        "    <p>In Copernicus Browser, you can view two kinds of statistical information for your imagery: a line chart of values through time for either a point or a polygon, and a histogram of values (see the chapter Statistical Analysis on our [Copernicus Browser page](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Applications/Browser.html#statistical-analysis)). To enable statistical features, an evalscript supporting statistical API should be used in your layers.<br><br>\n",
        "    Because statistics operate on the indicator values themselves (and not on RGB), you must add an additional output to the evalscript, which returns the value without conversion to color. For example, statistics can be calculated for values of B04 or for an index like NDVI. Additionally, the evalscript should include dataMask to exclude no-data values from the calculation (no-data pixels often have value 0, which could skew the statistics), and it’s also recommended to check for presence of clouds, so we can exclude them as well (cloudy pixels usually have very high values, which could also skew the results). The user can exclude any pixels from the statistics, such as, for example, snow or water.<br><br>    \n",

        "* `index`: Optional. Returning the raw values of your index, enabling the histogram functionality. Use FLOAT32 format to include decimals and negative values.\n",
        "* `eobrowserStats`: Mandatory. An output containing both the index values and cloud information, used for line chart generation. Cloud information will allow us to filter the tiles by maximum cloud coverage. Use FLOAT32 format to include decimals and negative values.\n",

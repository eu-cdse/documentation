The Landsat programme is a joint USGS and NASA-led enterprise for Earth observation that represents the world's longest running system of satellites for moderate-resolution optical remote sensing for land, coastal areas and shallow waters.

Landsat-8 carries the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). OLI provides imagery in the VIS, NIR and SWIR spectral ranges.  It acquires images with 15 m panchromatic and 30 m multi-spectral spatial resolutions, covering a wide 185 km swath. This allows it to capture extensive areas of the Earth's landscape while maintaining enough resolution to identify features like urban centers, farms, forests, and other land uses. The entire Earth falls within view once every 16 days due to Landsat-8’s near-polar orbit. The TIRS instrument is a thermal imager operating in a pushbroom mode with two Infra-Red channels: 10.8 µm and 12 µm with 100 m spatial resolution.

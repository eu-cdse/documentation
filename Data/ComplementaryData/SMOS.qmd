```

The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was launched on 2 November 2009. It is one of the European Space Agency's Earth Explorer missions, which form the science and research element of ESA’s Living Planet Programme.

The SMOS payload consists of the Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) instrument, a passive microwave 2-D interferometric radiometer operating in the L-band (1.413 GHz, 21 cm) within a protected wavelength/frequency band. The SMOS mission operates on a sun-synchronous orbit (dusk-dawn 6am/6pm). SMOS measurements are made over a range of incidence angles (0 to 55°) across a swath of approximately 1000 km with a spatial resolution of 35 to 50 km. MIRAS can provide measurements in dual and full polarisation, the latter being its current mode of operation.

SMOS Level 1 data products are designed for scientific and operational users who need to work with calibrated MIRAS instrument measurements, while SMOS Level 2 data products are designed for scientific and operational users who need to work with geo-located estimates of soil moisture and sea surface salinity as retrieved from the Level 1 dataset.

Access to SMOS data is possible via API

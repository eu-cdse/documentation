The Landsat programme is a joint USGS and NASA-led enterprise for Earth observation that represents the world's longest running system of satellites for moderate-resolution optical remote sensing for land, coastal areas and shallow waters.

Landsat-5 was launched on 1 March 1984 and ended its mission on 5 June 2013. It carried the Thematic Mapper (TM), a multispectral scanning radiometer operating in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It was characterized by 185 km swath width and 30 m resolution for visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR), and 120 m for thermal infrared (TIR). The acquired Landsat TM scene covers an area of approximately 183 km x 172.8 km. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection of a path and a row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 100 m). A full image consists of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each uncompressed band in the VIS, NIR, SWIR and TIR spectral regions requires 40 MB of storage space.

The objective of Landsat-5 and every Landsat mission has been to repeatedly image Earth's land and coastal areas in order to monitor changes to these areas over time.

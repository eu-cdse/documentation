The [Sentinel-1 radar imaging mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1){target="_blank"} is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continous all-weather, day and night imagery for Land and Maritime Monitoring. C-band synthentic aperture radar imaging has the advantage of operating at wavelenghts that are not obstructed by clouds or lack of illumination and therefore can acquire data during day or night under all weather conditions.

**The end of mission of the Sentinel-1B satellite has been declared in July 2022**
<br>On 23 December 2021, Copernicus Sentinel-1B experienced an anomaly related to the instrument electronics power supply provided by the satellite platform, leaving it unable to deliver radar data. Despite all investigations and recovery attempts, ESA and the European Commission had to announce that it is the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B. Copernicus Sentinel-1A remains fully operational. More information about the end of the mission for the Sentinel-1B satellite can be found on the webpage [Mission ends for Copernicus Sentinel-1B satellite](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite){target="_blank"}.
<br>In response to the loss of Sentinel-1B, **the mission observation scenario of Sentinel-1A was adjusted**, affecting the nominal global coverage frequency. An up-to-date overview of the observation scenario in place can be consulted on the webpage [Sentinel-1 Observation Scenario](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario){target="_blank"}. Some regions are currently not observed by Sentinel-1. Nevertheless, the regions that are still observed, now have a repeat cycle of 12 days under a one-satellite constellation scenario, which affects possible interferometric analyses.


Sentinel data products are made available systematically and free of charge to all data users including the general public, scientific and commercial users. These [data products](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/data-products){target="_blank"} are available in single polarisation for Wave mode and dual polarisation or single polarisation for SM, IW and EW modes.

# Derived products & Processing options

Sentinel-1 data can be accessed and processed in different ways within Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. Below we have compiled an overview of all the options to help you decide which one to use.

## [Sentinel-1 RTC](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/Additional.html#sentinel-1-rtc) 
[Sentinel-1 RTC](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/Additional.html#sentinel-1-rtc) (Radiometric Terrain Correction) SAR Backscatter is a product processed from Sentinel-1 GRD data and compliant with [CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) specifications](https://ceos-dev.ceos.org/ard/) for Normalised Radar Backscatter (NRB) products. Orthorectification is based on Copernicus DEM and no speckle filtering is applied. ([Additional product information](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/sentinel-1-ard-normalised-radar-backscatter-nrb-product))

## Copernicus Sentinel-1 Mosaics

Sentinel-1 GRD monthly and yearly mosaics (available soon).

It is planned that mosaics will be processed with the following Sentinel Hub processing options:

- Orthorectification with Copernicus 10m/30m DEM
- Radiometric Terrain Correction
- No speckle filtering applied 

## [Sentinel Hub processing options](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data/S1GRD.html#processing-options) 

Sentinel Hub offers the following processing options in the [Sentinel-1 GRD processing chain](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data/S1GRD.html#processing-chain):

- [Backscatter coefficients](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data/S1GRD.html#processing-options):

    - beta0
    - sigma0
    - gamma0 (ellipsoid)
    - gamma0 (terrain) &rarr; **gamma0 RTC can only be performed if orthorectification is enabled**

- [Lee Speckle Filtering](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data/S1GRD.html#processing-options) applied on source data after calibration and noise removal
- [Orthorectification](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Data/S1GRD.html#processing-options) with Range-Doppler terrain correction using one of the following DEMs:

    - Copernicus 10m/30m DEM (10m resolution inside [39 European states](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/collections/copernicus-digital-elevation-model) including islands and 30m elsewhere.)
    - Copernicus 30m DEM
    - Copernicus 90m DEM 

## [CloudFerro processing options](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/On-Demand%20Production%20API.html) 

CloudFerro offers CARD-BS and COH6/COH12 products as a [service on demand](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/On-Demand%20Production%20API.html): 

- [Sentinel-1 (CARD-BS) BackScatter](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/Additional.html#sentinel-1-card-bs)

    - This processing option contains gamma0 geometric terrain correction (orthorectification), which is identical to the gamma0 (ellipsoid) backscatter coefficient with orthorectification option in Sentinel Hub processing options. No Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC) is applied to this product. 
    - [Additional information](https://creodias.eu/eodata/sentinel-1/sentinel-1-l2-backscatter-bs/).

- [Sentinel-1 (CARD-COH) Coherence](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/On-Demand%20Production%20API.html)

    - The Sentinel-1 CARD COH (Copernicus Analysis Ready Data Coherence) processor generates a Sentinel-1 Level 2 product describing the coherence of a pair of images - 12 days apart. Concurrently, a terrain-correction (using DEM) is performed. 
    - [Additional information](https://creodias.eu/eodata/sentinel-1/sentinel-1-l3-bs-monthly-com/).

## openEO processing options 

openEO provides the **[sar_backscatter()](https://processes.openeo.org/draft/#sar_backscatter)** method to process, calibrate and normalise Sentinel-1 radar backscatter products with the following processing options:

- **sigma0-ellipsoid**: ground area computed with ellipsoid earth model
- **sigma0-terrain**: ground area computed with terrain earth model &rarr; **sigma0 RTC**

For orthorectification processes, the method utilises the Copernicus 30m DEM.

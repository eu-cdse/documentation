```
The [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) comprises a land monitoring constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased at 180° to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of Earth's surface changes.

The [Sentinel-2 products](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products) are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size, along with a single orbit. A granule is the minimum indivisible partition of a product (containing all possible spectral bands).


<!-- Ideas to further include (step by step):

* indication of ARD vs unpprojected data
* links to tutorials, notebooks
* links to catalog, browser, openEO
* thumbnail
* link to 'parent collection'? For instance, L2A links to L1C??
* how to separate usable collections from engineering products??
* listing of bands -->

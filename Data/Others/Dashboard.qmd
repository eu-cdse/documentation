This dashboard keeps users and stakeholders up to date with the latest information about available satellite data. 

Access Link : [https://operations.dashboard.copernicus.eu/index](https://operations.dashboard.copernicus.eu/index){target="_blank"}


It aims at providing details on the status of the Copernicus operations, covering Sentinel-1, 2, 3 (Land) and Sentinel-5P.  

The **Homepage** includes a high-level overview of the Copernicus Sentinel missions over the past 24 h, including the number of missions, time spent gathering data, data volumes, and the number of products delivered. 

The **Events** tab provides details of events over the past three months that have impact on the completeness of the data production, such as planned calibration activities, manoeuvrers, or anomalies. The information of which data is affected is included.

The **Data Takes** tab hosts a real-time list of available collections delivered by the missions, enabling users to scan through these products to find data that meet their research and development requirements, and to assess their availability.

The **Publication Statistics** tab provides detailed information on Copernicus Sentinel data – such as number of products delivered – covering anywhere between the past 24h and the past three months. These insights are represented visually, with one graphical representation per mission that is subdivided by sensor.

##### Sentinel-2 L2A Baselines

The Sentinel-2 L2A collection within the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem originates from three sources: 

**(1)** operational Copernicus processing, i.e. data previously accessible on the Copernicus Open Access Hub (formerly known as Sentinels Scientific Data Hub);
 
**(2)** reprocessing of the L2A archive from 2015 until the end of 2021 [(Collection 1)](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/sentinel-data-access/sentinel-products/sentinel-2-data-products/collection-1-level-2a){target="_blank"}, and ;

**(3)** data generated by CloudFerro using various versions of the publicly available [Sen2Cor processor](https://step.esa.int/main/snap-supported-plugins/sen2cor/){target="_blank"}. This data will be removed once replaced by the reprocessing of the L2A (point 2 above), which is planned to be completed in April 2024

These products can be differentiated by the [OData](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/OData.html#query-by-attributes){target="_blank"} and [OpenSearch](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/describe.xml){target="_blank"} **(origin)** attribute (ESA or CloudFerro) and by the **'processingBaseline'** attribute. Processing Baseline is presented on Copernicus Browser as a "Processor version" attribute.

The current state of the archive of the Sentinel-L2A data is as follows:

The Sentinel-2 Collection 1 (reprocessed data) featuring processing baseline 5.00 is gradually ingested into the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. This ingestion should be completed in the end of Q1 2024. **The products with older processing baselines** will be available together with **the products with processing baseline 5.00**, for a duration of at least 6 more months (until Q3 2024). 

Please refer to the article [Copernicus SENTINEL-2 Collection-1 Availability Status](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/copernicus-sentinel-2-collection-1-availability-status) that aims at providing up-to-date progress information on the proceedings of the generation of Collection-1 and on the gradual availability of Collection-1 Level-1C and Level-2A products.

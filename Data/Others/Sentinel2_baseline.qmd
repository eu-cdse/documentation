##### Sentinel-2 Processing Baseline

The processing baseline indicates the version of the processing algorithm applied to the raw data to generate the Sentinel-2 products.  

Re-processed products are referred as Sentinel-2 Collection-1 and they are different from the products delivered in the framework of the nominal sensing operations.

More details about the Sentinel-2 Processing Baselines, associated operational products and Collection-1 products, are available [here](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s2-processing){target="_blank"}.

L1C and L2A Processing Baselines with the full list of processors' releases is available on the [SentiBoard Processors page](https://operations.dashboard.copernicus.eu/processors-viewer.html?search=S2){target="_blank"}.

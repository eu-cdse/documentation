```

The [Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p){target="_blank"} mission is the first Copernicus mission dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere. 

The main objective of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is to perform atmospheric measurements with high spatio-temporal resolution, to be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation, and climate monitoring & forecasting.

There are [different data products](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p/data-products){target="_blank"} associated with the three levels of TROPOMI processing: Level-0, Level-1B and Level-2.

## Processing restrictions in openEO

In the present implementation of openEO and Sentinel Hub API, users are limited to processing or downloading only one band at a time when dealing with Sentinel 5P collection. 

Hence, if you try to load or process two different bands simultaneously using any of these APIs, like methane and NO2, you'll get an error message indicating that the script can only use one product type at once.

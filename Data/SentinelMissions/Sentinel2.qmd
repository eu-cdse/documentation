The [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2){target="_blank"} comprises a land monitoring constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased at 180° to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of Earth's surface changes.

The satellites carry a single payload: the optical Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) that samples 13 spectral bands: four bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution.

Each [Sentinel-2 products](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s2-products){target="_blank"} is composed of approximately 110x110 km tiles in cartographic geometry (UTM/WGS84 projection). Earth is subdivided on a predefined set of tiles, defined in UTM/WGS84 projection and using a 100 km step. However, each tile has a surface of 110x110 km² in order to provide large overlap with the neighbouring.

<!-- Ideas to further include (step by step):

* links to openEO
* link to 'parent collection'? For instance, L2A links to L1C??
* how to separate usable collections from engineering products?? -->

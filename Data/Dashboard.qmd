The Copernicus Sentinel Operations Dashboard keeps users and stakeholders up to date with the latest information about satellite data made available to the users. The Dashboard is now live on [https://operations.dashboard.copernicus.eu/index](https://operations.dashboard.copernicus.eu/index). 


This Dashboard aims at providing details on the status of the Copernicus operations, covering Sentinel-1, 2, 3 (Land) and Sentinel-5P.  

The dashboard homepage includes a high-level overview of the Copernicus Sentinel missions over the past 24 h, including the number of missions, time spent gathering data, data volumes, and the number of products delivered. 

The Events tab provides details of events over the past three months that have impact on the completeness of the data production, such as planned calibration activities, manoeuvrers, or anomalies. The information of which data is affected is included.

Copernicus [Sentinel-6](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/ca/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-6/overview){target="_blank"} Michael Freilich includes two satellites that will fly sequentially, launched in 2020 and 2025, carrying a state-of-the art optimised payload.

Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich is an Earth Observation satellite mission developed to provide enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state that started in 1992, with the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, then continued by the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions.
